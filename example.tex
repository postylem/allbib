% \maketitle
Here is an example using \texttt{all-biblatex.bib} with Bib\LaTeX{}.
First, some classics like \citet{chomsky.n:1957, kolmogorov.a:1968,tesniere.l:1959, estes.w:1959}, 
and a document with DOI and URL: \citet{earley.j:1970}.
Also, preprints like
\citet{tay.y:2022,wu.m:2022,schijndel.m:2020psyarxiv}.
And, one document that is unpublished: \citet{narayanan.s:2004}.

Note: \texttt{all-biblatex.bib} complies with
the format recommendations for Bib\LaTeX, whereas \texttt{all.bib} uses those for Bib\TeX. 
They both are generated from the same underlying database.
I would like to just use the Bib\LaTeX version, as it is a more modern format, but depending on the use-case, the Bib\TeX version may be required, so I'll keep generating both for now. In practice, the difference mostly means \texttt{all-biblatex.bib} has \emph{date} fields and may use Unicode characters, where \texttt{all.bib} has \emph{year}, \emph{month}, and \emph{day} fields, and uses no Unicode characters, etc.
