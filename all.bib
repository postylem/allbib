A fast, compact natural language parser must implement a strategy with low space requirements and few local ambiguities. It is also widely assumed in the psycholinguistics literature that extremely limited short-term space is available to the human parser, and that sentences containing center-embedded constructions are incomprehensible because processing them requires more space than is available. However, we show that the parsing strategies most psycholinguists assume require less space for processing center-embedded constructions than for processing other perfectly comprehensible constructions. We present alternative strategies for which center-embedded constructions do require more space than other constructions.},

  abstract = {Summary. Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo methods have emerged as the two main tools to sample from high dimensional probability distributions. Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a L\'evy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

  abstract = {We review information-theoretic measures of cognitive load during sentence processing that have been used to quantify word prediction effort. Two such measures, surprisal and next-word entropy, suffer from shortcomings when employed for a predictive processing view. We propose a novel metric, lookahead information gain, that can overcome these short-comings. We estimate the different measures using probabilistic language models. Subsequently, we put them to the test by analysing how well the estimated measures predict human processing effort in three data sets of naturalistic sentence reading. Our results replicate the well known effect of surprisal on word reading effort, but do not indicate a role of next-word entropy or lookahead information gain. Our computational results suggest that, in a predictive processing system, the costs of predicting may outweigh the gains. This idea poses a potential limit to the value of a predictive mechanism for the processing of language. The result illustrates the unresolved problem of finding estimations of word-by-word prediction that, first, are truly independent of perceptual processing of the to-be-predicted words, second, are statistically reliable predictors of experimental data, and third, can be derived from more general assumptions about the cognitive processes involved.},

  abstract = {This paper explores two related factors which influence variation in duration, prosodic structure and redundancy in spontaneous speech. We argue that the constraint of producing robust communication while efficiently expending articulatory effort leads to an inverse relationship between language redundancy and duration. The inverse relationship improves communication robustness by spreading information more evenly across the speech signal, yielding a smoother signal redundancy profile.We argue that prosodic prominence is a linguistic means of achieving smooth signal redundancy. Prosodic prominence increases syllable duration and coincides to a large extent with unpredictable sections of speech, and thus leads to a smoother signal redundancy.The results of linear regressions carried out between measures of redundancy, syllable duration and prosodic structure in a large corpus of spontaneous speech confirm: (1) an inverse relationship between language redundancy and duration, and (2) a strong relationship between prosodic prominence and duration.The fact that a large proportion of the variance predicted by language redundancy and prosodic prominence is nonunique suggests that, in English, prosodic prominence structure is the means with which constraints caused by a robust signal requirement are expressed in spontaneous speech.},

We present empirical evidence that nonspecific subject NPs that have elsewhere been analyzed as remaining VP-internal occupy this position. We also offer theoretical arguments that transitive subjects may never remain internal to the VP at S-Structure in languages for which the Extended Projection Principle holds. Extending work by Bures (1992, 1993), we argue further that [Spec, TP] is implicated as a subject position in NP object shift constructions. Parametric availability of this one position accounts for a cluster of properties within the Germanic languages.},

  abstract = {During language comprehension, we routinely use information from the prior context to help identify the meaning of individual words. While measures of online processing difficulty, such as reading times, are strongly influenced by contextual predictability, there is disagreement about the mechanisms underlying this lexical predictability effect, with different models predicting different linking functions \textendash{} linear (Reichle, Rayner, \& Pollatsek, 2003) or logarithmic (Levy, 2008). To help resolve this debate, we conducted two highly-powered experiments (self-paced reading, N = 216; cross-modal picture naming, N = 36), and a meta-analysis of prior eye-tracking while reading studies (total N = 218). We observed a robust linear relationship between lexical predictability and word processing times across all three studies. Beyond their methodological implications, these findings also place important constraints on predictive processing models of language comprehension. In particular, these results directly contradict the empirical predictions of surprisal theory, while supporting a proportional pre-activation account of lexical prediction effects in comprehension.},

  abstract = {The variational autoencoder (VAE; Kingma, Welling (2014)) is a recently proposed generative model pairing a top-down generative network with a bottom-up recognition network which approximates posterior inference. It typically makes strong assumptions about posterior inference, for instance that the posterior distribution is approximately factorial, and that its parameters can be approximated with nonlinear regression from the observations. As we show empirically, the VAE objective can lead to overly simplified representations which fail to use the network's entire modeling capacity. We present the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE), a generative model with the same architecture as the VAE, but which uses a strictly tighter log-likelihood lower bound derived from importance weighting. In the IWAE, the recognition network uses multiple samples to approximate the posterior, giving it increased flexibility to model complex posteriors which do not fit the VAE modeling assumptions. We show empirically that IWAEs learn richer latent space representations than VAEs, leading to improved test log-likelihood on density estimation benchmarks.},

This framework casts criteria from the Bayesian literature of design as part of a single coherent approach. The decision-theoretic structure incorporates both linear and nonlinear design problems and it suggests possible new directions to the experimental design problem, motivated by the use of new utility functions. We show that, in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion.},

  abstract = {We present a novel approach for approximate sampling in probabilistic programs based on incremental inference. The key idea is to adapt the samples for a program P into samples for a program Q, thereby avoiding the expensive sampling computation for program Q. To enable incremental inference in probabilistic programming, our work: (i) introduces the concept of a trace translator which adapts samples from P into samples of Q, (ii) phrases this translation approach in the context of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), which gives theoretical guarantees that the adapted samples converge to the distribution induced by Q, and (iii) shows how to obtain a concrete trace translator by establishing a correspondence between the random choices of the two probabilistic programs. We implemented our approach in two different probabilistic programming systems and showed that, compared to methods that sample the program Q from scratch, incremental inference can lead to orders of magnitude increase in efficiency, depending on how closely related P and Q are.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the predictions of two theories of syntactic processing complexity, dependency locality theory (DLT) and surprisal, against the Dundee Corpus, which contains the eye-tracking record of 10 participants reading 51,000 words of newspaper text. Our results show that DLT integration cost is not a significant predictor of reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully predicts reading times for nouns. We also find evidence for integration cost effects at auxiliaries, not predicted by DLT. For surprisal, we demonstrate that an unlexicalized formulation of surprisal can predict reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. Comparing DLT integration cost and surprisal, we find that the two measures are uncorrelated, which suggests that a complete theory will need to incorporate both aspects of processing complexity. We conclude that eye-tracking corpora, which provide reading time data for naturally occurring, contextualized sentences, can complement experimental evidence as a basis for theories of processing complexity.},

  abstract = {I explore the hypothesis that the universal properties of human languages can be explained in terms of efficient communication given fixed human information processing constraints. I argue that under short-term memory constraints, optimal languages should exhibit information locality: words that depend on each other, both in their interpretation and in their statistical distribution, should be close to each other in linear order. The informationtheoretic approach to natural language motivates a study of quantitative syntax in Chapter 2, focusing on word order flexibility. In Chapter 3, I show comprehensive corpus evidence from over 40 languages that word order in grammar and usage is shaped by working memory constraints in the form of dependency locality: a pressure for syntactically linked words to be close. In Chapter 4, I develop a new formal model of language processing cost, called noisy-context surprisal, based on rational inference over noisy memory representations. This model unifies surprisal and memory effects and derives dependency locality effects as a subset of information locality effects. I show that the new processing model also resolves a long-standing paradox in the psycholinguistic literature, structural forgetting, where the effects of memory appear to be language-dependent. In the conclusion I discuss connections to probabilistic grammars, endocentricity, duality of patterning, incremental planning, and deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {It is now a common practice to compare models of human language processing by comparing how well they predict behavioral and neural measures of processing difficulty, such as reading times, on corpora of rich naturalistic linguistic materials. However, many of these corpora, which are based on naturally-occurring text, do not contain many of the low-frequency syntactic constructions that are often required to distinguish between processing theories. Here we describe a new corpus consisting of English texts edited to contain many low-frequency syntactic constructions while still sounding fluent to native speakers. The corpus is annotated with hand-corrected Penn Treebank-style parse trees and includes self-paced reading time data and aligned audio recordings. We give an overview of the content of the corpus, review recent work using the corpus, and release the data.},

MCMC algorithms like Gibbs sampling do not converge and importance sampling schemes generate many zero weight samples that are rejected, yielding an inefficient sampling process (the rejection problem). In this paper, we propose to augment importance sampling with systematic constraint-satisfaction search in order to overcome the rejection problem. The resulting SampleSearch scheme can be made unbiased by using a computationally expensive weighting scheme. To overcome this an approximation is proposed such that the resulting estimator is asymptotically unbiased. Our empirical results demonstrate the potential of our new scheme.},

  abstract = {Departing from traditional linguistic models, advances in deep learning have resulted in a new type of predictive (autoregressive) deep language models (DLMs). These models are trained to generate appropriate linguistic responses in a given context using a self-supervised prediction task. We provide empirical evidence that the human brain and autoregressive DLMs share two computational principles: 1) both are engaged in continuous prediction; 2) both represent words as a function of the previous context. Behaviorally, we demonstrate a match between humans and DLM's next-word predictions given sufficient contextual windows during the processing of a real-life narrative. Neurally, we demonstrate that the brain, like autoregressive DLMs, constantly predicts upcoming words in natural speech, hundreds of milliseconds before they are perceived. Finally, we show that DLM's contextual embeddings capture the neural representation of context-specific word meaning better than arbitrary or static semantic embeddings. Our findings suggest that autoregressive DLMs provide a novel and biologically feasible computational framework for studying the neural basis of language.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Toward a probabilistic theory of human sentence processing, this dissertation proposes a definition of computational work done in the course of analyzing sentences generated by formal grammars. It applies the idea of entropy from information theory to the set of derivations compatible with an initial substring of a sentence. Given a probabilistic grammar, this permits the set of such compatible derivations to be viewed as a random variable, and the change in uncertainty about the outcomes to be calculated. This definition of computational work is examined as a cognitive model of human sentence processing difficulty. To apply the model, a variety of existing syntactic proposals for English sentences are cast as probabilistic Generalized Phrase Structure Grammars (Gazdar et al., 1985) and probabilistic Minimalist Grammars (Stabler, 1997). It is shown that the amount of predicted processing effort in relative clauses correlates with the Accessibility Hierarchy of relativized grammatical relations (Keenan and Comrie, 1977) on a Kaynian (1994) view of relative clause structure. Results from three new on-line sentence reading experiments suggest that while genitivity has the role suggested by the Accessibility Hierarchy, extraction from oblique does not. Evidence is also found for a direct object/indirect object processing asymmetry, which can be derived from the proposed cognitive model under the assumption of a lexicalized probabilistic grammar.},

  abstract = {Icelandic dative-nominative constructions exhibit a syntactic hierarchy effect known as the Person Restriction: only third person nominatives may control agreement. In these constructions, there is variation between speakers in the extent to which the verb agrees with the nominative for number. Sigur\dh sson \& Holmberg (2008) explain this variation as arising due to differences between varieties in the timing of subject raising, using a split phi-probe. This paper revises their approach, using the feature gluttony mechanism for Agree developed in Coon \& Keine (2020), and a split phi-probe in which person probing precedes number probing. Within this framework, the observed variation can be captured by allowing variability two independent parameters: the timing of EPP subject raising, and the visibility of a number feature on dative DPs. The proposed mechanism describes the variation, including predicting the observed optional agreement in certain cases that previous literature had struggled to account for, and makes additional predictions about the differences between varieties in cases of syncretism within the verbal paradigm. An investigation into these predictions should allow this already well-studied area of Icelandic grammar to continue to be a useful test-case for crosslinguistic assumptions about the mechanism of Agree, and the status of dative arguments.},

  abstract = {Are pairs of words that tend to occur together also likely to stand in a linguistic dependency? This empirical question is motivated by a long history of literature in cognitive science, psycholinguistics, and NLP. In this work we contribute an extensive analysis of the relationship between linguistic dependencies and statistical dependence between words. Improving on previous work, we introduce the use of large pretrained language models to compute contextualized estimates of the pointwise mutual information between words (CPMI). For multiple models and languages, we extract dependency trees which maximize CPMI, and compare to gold standard linguistic dependencies. Overall, we find that CPMI dependencies achieve an unlabelled undirected attachment score of at most \$\textbackslash approx 0.5\$. While far above chance, and consistently above a non-contextualized PMI baseline, this score is generally comparable to a simple baseline formed by connecting adjacent words. We analyze which kinds of linguistic dependencies are best captured in CPMI dependencies, and also find marked differences between the estimates of the large pretrained language models, illustrating how their different training schemes affect the type of dependencies they capture.},

  abstract = {Are pairs of words that tend to occur together also likely to stand in a linguistic dependency? This empirical question is motivated by a long history of literature in cognitive science, psycholinguistics, and NLP. In this work we contribute an extensive analysis of the relationship between linguistic dependencies and statistical dependence between words. Improving on previous work, we introduce the use of large pretrained language models to compute contextualized estimates of the pointwise mutual information between words (CPMI). For multiple models and languages, we extract dependency trees which maximize CPMI, and compare to gold standard linguistic dependencies. Overall, we find that CPMI dependencies achieve an unlabelled undirected attachment score of at most \$\textbackslash approx 0.5\$. While far above chance, and consistently above a non-contextualized PMI baseline, this score is generally comparable to a simple baseline formed by connecting adjacent words. We analyze which kinds of linguistic dependencies are best captured in CPMI dependencies, and also find marked differences between the estimates of the large pretrained language models, illustrating how their different training schemes affect the type of dependencies they capture.},

However, existing deep models with stacked layers do not explicitly model any sort of hierarchical process. In this paper, we propose a recursive Transformer model based on differentiable CKY style binary trees to emulate this composition process, and we extend the bidirectional language model pre-training objective to this architecture, attempting to predict each word given its left and right abstraction nodes. To scale up our approach, we also introduce an efficient pruning and growing algorithm to reduce the time complexity and enable encoding in linear time. Experimental results on language modeling and unsupervised parsing show the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {Syntactic surprisal has been shown to have an effect on human sentence processing, and can be predicted from prefix probabilities of generative incremental parsers. Recent state-of-the-art incremental generative neural parsers are able to produce accurate parses and surprisal values but have unbounded stack memory, which may be used by the neural parser to maintain explicit in-order representations of all previously parsed words, inconsistent with results of human memory experiments. In contrast, humans seem to have a bounded working memory, demonstrated by inhibited performance on word recall in multi-clause sentences (Bransford and Franks, 1971), and on center-embedded sentences (Miller and Isard,1964). Bounded statistical parsers exist, but are less accurate than neural parsers in predict-ing reading times. This paper describes a neural incremental generative parser that is able to provide accurate surprisal estimates and can be constrained to use a bounded stack. Results show that the accuracy gains of neural parsers can be reliably extended to psycholinguistic modeling without risk of distortion due to un-bounded working memory.},

  abstract = {Incremental processing allows interactive systems to respond based on partial inputs, which is a desirable property e.g. in dialogue agents. The currently popular Transformer architecture inherently processes sequences as a whole, abstracting away the notion of time. Recent work attempts to apply Transformers incrementally via restart-incrementality by repeatedly feeding, to an unchanged model, increasingly longer input prefixes to produce partial outputs. However, this approach is computationally costly and does not scale efficiently for long sequences. In parallel, we witness efforts to make Transformers more efficient, e.g. the Linear Transformer (LT) with a recurrence mechanism. In this work, we examine the feasibility of LT for incremental NLU in English. Our results show that the recurrent LT model has better incremental performance and faster inference speed compared to the standard Transformer and LT with restart-incrementality, at the cost of part of the non-incremental (full sequence) quality. We show that the performance drop can be mitigated by training the model to wait for right context before committing to an output and that training with input prefixes is beneficial for delivering correct partial outputs.},

  abstract = {We show that constituency parsing benefits from unsupervised pre-training across a variety of languages and a range of pre-training conditions. We first compare the benefits of no pre-training, fastText, ELMo, and BERT for English and find that BERT outperforms ELMo, in large part due to increased model capacity, whereas ELMo in turn outperforms the non-contextual fastText embeddings. We also find that pre-training is beneficial across all 11 languages tested; however, large model sizes (more than 100 million parameters) make it computationally expensive to train separate models for each language. To address this shortcoming, we show that joint multilingual pre-training and fine-tuning allows sharing all but a small number of parameters between ten languages in the final model. The 10x reduction in model size compared to fine-tuning one model per language causes only a 3.2\% relative error increase in aggregate. We further explore the idea of joint fine-tuning and show that it gives low-resource languages a way to benefit from the larger datasets of other languages. Finally, we demonstrate new state-of-the-art results for 11 languages, including English (95.8 F1) and Chinese (91.8 F1).},

Our goal is to induce a syntactic representation that commits to syntactic choices only as they are incrementally revealed by the input, in contrast with standard representations that must make output choices such as attachments speculatively and later throw out conflicting analyses. Our learned representations achieve 93.72 F1 on the Penn Treebank with as few as 5 bits per word, and at 8 bits per word they achieve 94.97 F1, which is comparable with other state of the art parsing models when using the same pre-trained embeddings. We also provide an analysis of the representations learned by our system, investigating properties such as the interpretable syntactic features captured by the system and mechanisms for deferred resolution of syntactic ambiguities.},

Their method of constructing the complete data sets is closely related to the Gibbs sampler. Both required iterations, and, similar to the EM algorithm, convergence can be slow. We introduce in this article an alternative procedure that involves imputing the missing data sequentially and computing appropriate importance sampling weights. In many applications this new procedure works very well without the need for iterations. Sensitivity analysis, influence analysis, and updating with new data can be performed cheaply. Bayesian prediction and model selection can also be incorporated. Examples taken from a wide range of applications are used for illustration.},

  abstract = {This thesis takes up the problem of syntactic comprehension, or parsing\textemdash how an agent (human or machine) with knowledge of a specific language goes about inferring the hierarchical structural relationships underlying a surface string in the language. I take the position that probabilistic models of combining evidential information are cognitively plausible and practically useful for syntactic comprehension. In particular, the thesis applies probabilistic methods in investigating the relationship between word order and psycholinguistic models of comprehension; and in the practical problems of accuracy and efficiency in parsing sentences with syntactic discontinuity. On the psychological side, the thesis proposes a theory of expectation-based processing difficulty as a consequence of probabilistic syntactic disambiguation: the ease of processing a word during comprehension is determined primarily by the degree to which that word is expected. I identify a class of syntactic phenomena, associated primarily with verb-final clause order, where the predictions of expectation-based processing diverge most sharply from more established locality-based theories of processing difficulty. Using existing probabilistic parsing algorithms and syntactically annotated data sources, I show that the expectation-based theory matches a range of established experimental psycholinguistic results better than locality-based theories. The comparison of probabilistic- and locality-driven processing theories is a crucial area of psycholinguistic research due to its implications for the relationship between linguistic production and comprehension, and more generally for theories of modularity in cognitive science. The thesis also takes up the problem of probabilistic models for discontinuous constituency, when phrases do not consist of continuous substrings of a sentence. Discontinuity poses a computational challenge in parsing, because it expands the set of possible substructures in a sentence beyond the bound, quadratic in sentence length, on the set of possible continuous constituents. For discontinuous constituency, I investigate the problem of accuracy employing discriminative classifiers organized on principles of syntactic theory and used to introduce discontinuous relationships into otherwise strictly context-free phrase structure trees; and the problem of efficiency in joint inference over both continuous and discontinuous structures, using probabilistic instantiations of mildly context-sensitive grammatical formalisms and factorizing grammatical generalizations into probabilistic components of dominance and linear order.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the role of resource allocation as a source of processing difficulty in human sentence comprehension. The paper proposes a simple information-theoretic characterization of processing difficulty as the work incurred by resource reallocation during parallel, incremental, probabilistic disambiguation in sentence comprehension, and demonstrates its equivalence to the theory of Hale [Hale, J. (2001). A probabilistic Earley parser as a psycholinguistic model. In Proceedings of NAACL (Vol. 2, pp. 159\textendash 166)], in which the difficulty of a word is proportional to its surprisal (its negative log-probability) in the context within which it appears. This proposal subsumes and clarifies findings that high-constraint contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and connects these findings to well-known models of parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition, the theory leads to a number of specific predictions about the role of expectation in syntactic comprehension, including the reversal of locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically constrained contexts, and conditions under which increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper examines a range of established results bearing on these predictions, and shows that they are largely consistent with the surprisal theory.},

  abstract = {In prevailing approaches to human sentence comprehension, the outcome of the word recognition process is assumed to be a categorical representation with no residual uncertainty. Yet perception is inevitably uncertain, and a system making optimal use of available information might retain this uncertainty and interactively recruit grammatical analysis and subsequent perceptual input to help resolve it. To test for the possibility of such an interaction, we tracked readers' eye movements as they read sentences constructed to vary in (i) whether an early word had near neighbors of a different grammatical category, and (ii) how strongly another word further downstream cohered grammatically with these potential near neighbors. Eye movements indicated that readers maintain uncertain beliefs about previously read word identities, revise these beliefs on the basis of relative grammatical consistency with subsequent input, and use these changing beliefs to guide saccadic behavior in ways consistent with principles of rational probabilistic inference.},

Just as systematic search algorithms like A* recursively build complete solutions from partial solutions, sequential rejection sampling recursively builds exact samples over high-dimensional spaces from exact samples over lower-dimensional subspaces. Our algorithm recovers widely-used particle filters as an approximate variant without adaptation, and a randomized version of the directed arc consistency algorithm with backtracking when applied to deterministic problems. In this paper, we present the mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings of our approach and measure its behavior on ferromagnetic Isings and other probabilistic graphical models, obtaining exact and approximate samples in a range of situations.},

  abstract = {Researchers investigating the acquisition of phrase-structure grammars from raw text have had only mixed success. In particular, unsupervised learning techniques, such as the inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979) for estimating the parameters of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), tend to produce grammars that structure text in ways contrary to our linguistic intuitions. One effective way around this problem is to use hand-structured text like the Penn Treebank (Marcus, 1991) to constrain the learner: (Pereira and Schabes, 1992) demonstrate that the inside-outside algorithm can learn grammars effectively given such constraint, and currently the best performing parsers are trained on treebanks (Black et al., 1992; Magerman, 1995).},

  abstract = {We present a dataset for evaluating the grammaticality of the predictions of a language model. We automatically construct a large number of minimally different pairs of English sentences, each consisting of a grammatical and an ungrammatical sentence. The sentence pairs represent different variations of structure-sensitive phenomena: subject-verb agreement, reflexive anaphora and negative polarity items. We expect a language model to assign a higher probability to the grammatical sentence than the ungrammatical one. In an experiment using this data set, an LSTM language model performed poorly on many of the constructions. Multi-task training with a syntactic objective (CCG supertagging) improved the LSTM's accuracy, but a large gap remained between its performance and the accuracy of human participants recruited online. This suggests that there is considerable room for improvement over LSTMs in capturing syntax in a language model.},

In clear and stimulating analyses Mel'cuk promotes syntactic description in terms of dependency rather than in terms of more familiar phrase-structure. The notions of dependency relations and dependency structure are introduced and substantiated, and the advantages of dependency representation are demonstrated by applying it to a number of popular linguistic problems, e.g. grammatical subject and ergative construction. A wide array of linguistic data is used \textendash{} the well-known (Dyirbal), the less known (Lezgian), and the more recent (Alutor). Several "exotic" cases of Russian are discussed to show how dependency can be used to solve difficult technical problems. The book is not only formal and rigorous, but also strongly theory-oriented and data-based. Special attention is paid to linguistic terminology, specifically to its logical consistency. The dependency formalism is presented within the framework of a new semantics-oriented general linguistic theory, Meaning-Text theory.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that inverse marking and portmanteau agreement are in complementary distribution in Algonquin: inverse marking is possible only in contexts where portmanteau agreement is not. This correlation holds despite intralanguage variation in both phenomena. The paper proposes that the two phenomena pattern together because both are determined by the outcome of the Agree operation on Infl. When Infl enters a Multiple Agree relation with both arguments, the realization of portmanteau agreement morphology is possible. When Infl agrees only with the object, it duplicates the result of an earlier object agreement operation on Voice. The presence of identical features on Infl and Voice triggers an impoverishment operation that deletes the features of Voice, resulting in its spellout as an underspecified elsewhere form\textemdash which is the exponent that we know descriptively as the inverse marker. This analysis explains why inverse marking and portmanteau agreement never co-occur in Algonquin: the two phenomena are determined by alternative outcomes of the Agree operation on Infl. The analysis also enables a simple account of the intralanguage variation in the patterning of the two phenomena, which is shown to follow from variation in the specification of the probe on Infl.},

  abstract = {Dependency parsers are among the most crucial tools in natural language processing as they have many important applications in downstream tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation and knowledge acquisition. We introduce the Yara Parser, a fast and accurate open-source dependency parser based on the arc-eager algorithm and beam search. It achieves an unlabeled accuracy of 93.32 on the standard WSJ test set which ranks it among the top dependency parsers. At its fastest, Yara can parse about 4000 sentences per second when in greedy mode (1 beam). When optimizing for accuracy (using 64 beams and Brown cluster features), Yara can parse 45 sentences per second. The parser can be trained on any syntactic dependency treebank and different options are provided in order to make it more flexible and tunable for specific tasks. It is released with the Apache version 2.0 license and can be used for both commercial and academic purposes. The parser can be found at https://github.com/yahoo/YaraParser.},

Shannon's mathematical tools and methods are distinguished from his theory, which consists of 23 theorems setting forth the conditions for maximum efficiency in electromechanical signal transmission. Attempts to apply Shannon's theory to our field are reviewed, along with previous critiques, and it is recommended that future uses of Shannon's theory adopt a more methodologically rigorous approach. In particular, it is argued that Shannon's assumptions must be shown to hold before his theorems can be successfully applied.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in stochastic gradient variational inference have made it possible to perform variational Bayesian inference with posterior approximations containing auxiliary random variables. This enables us to explore a new synthesis of variational inference and Monte Carlo methods where we incorporate one or more steps of MCMC into our variational approximation. By doing so we obtain a rich class of inference algorithms bridging the gap between variational methods and MCMC, and offering the best of both worlds: fast posterior approximation through the maximization of an explicit objective, with the option of trading off additional computation for additional accuracy. We describe the theoretical foundations that make this possible and show some promising first results.},

  abstract = {When Shannon entropy is used as a criterion in the optimal design of experiments, advantage can be taken of the classical identity representing the joint entropy of parameters and observations as the sum of the marginal entropy of the observations and the preposterior conditional entropy of the parameters. Following previous work in which this idea was used in spatial sampling, the method is applied to standard parameterized Bayesian optimal experimental design. Under suitable conditions, which include non-linear as well as linear regression models, it is shown in a few steps that maximizing the marginal entropy of the sample is equivalent to minimizing the pre-posterior entropy, the usual Bayesian criterion, thus avoiding the use of conditional distributions. It is shown using this marginal formulation that under normality assumptions every standard model which has a two-point prior distribution on the parameters gives an optimal design supported on a single point. Other results include a new asymptotic formula which applies as the error variance is large and bounds on support size.},

  abstract = {It is well known that real-time human language processing is highly incremental and context-driven, and that the strength of a comprehender's expectation for each word encountered is a key determinant of the difficulty of integrating that word into the preceding context. In reading, this differential difficulty is largely manifested in the amount of time taken to read each word. While numerous studies over the past thirty years have shown expectation-based effects on reading times driven by lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and other information sources, there has been little progress in establishing the quantitative relationship between expectation (or prediction) and reading times. Here, by combining a state-of-the-art computational language model, two large behavioral data-sets, and non-parametric statistical techniques, we establish for the first time the quantitative form of this relationship, finding that it is logarithmic over six orders of magnitude in estimated predictability. This result is problematic for a number of established models of eye movement control in reading, but lends partial support to an optimal perceptual discrimination account of word recognition. We also present a novel model in which language processing is highly incremental well below the level of the individual word, and show that it predicts both the shape and time-course of this effect. At a more general level, this result provides challenges for both anticipatory processing and semantic integration accounts of lexical predictability effects. And finally, this result provides evidence that comprehenders are highly sensitive to relative differences in predictability \textendash{} even for differences between highly unpredictable words \textendash{} and thus helps bring theoretical unity to our understanding of the role of prediction at multiple levels of linguistic structure in real-time language comprehension.},

It is shown that mean Hamming distance is a good general guide to coding efficiency, except in the case of a minimum error strategy with a deletion error channel, where coding efficiency is critically dependent on noise level. An experiment in which subjects selected codes in an artificial language suggests that the process of recall from memory is similar to the process of transmitting over a deletion error channel with a minimum error strategy. A similar interpretation can be placed on the analysis of consonant systems in English, French, German and Welsh, where the sets of consonants of a given class in a given environment are considered as codes whose alphabet is the phonological distinctive feature system of Halle (1958)},

Our goal is to use bilingual cues to learn improved parsing models for each language and to evaluate these models on held-out monolingual test data. We formulate a generative Bayesian model which seeks to explain the observed parallel data through a combination of bilingual and monolingual parameters. To this end, we adapt a formalism known as unordered tree alignment to our probabilistic setting. Using this formalism, our model loosely binds parallel trees while allowing language-specific syntactic structure. We perform inference under this model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and dynamic programming. Applying this model to three parallel corpora (Korean-English, Urdu-English, and Chinese-English) we find substantial performance gains over the CCM model, a strong monolingual baseline. On average, across a variety of testing scenarios, our model achieves an 8.8 absolute gain in F-measure.},

Second, the non-canonical meanings of words in an idiom are contingent on the presence of other words in the idiom. Linguistic theories differ on whether these properties depend on one another, as well as whether special theoretical machinery is needed to accommodate idioms. We define two measures that correspond to the properties above, and we show that idioms fall at the expected intersection of the two dimensions, but that the dimensions themselves are not correlated. Our results suggest that introducing special machinery to handle idioms may not be warranted.},

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.},

To this end, we use an emerging branch of information theory called partial information decomposition (PID) and track the informational properties of the neurons through training. We find two differentiated phases during the training process: a first short phase in which the neurons learn redundant information about the target, and a second phase in which neurons start specialising and each of them learns unique information about the target. We also find that in smaller networks individual neurons learn more specific information about certain features of the input, suggesting that learning pressure can encourage disentangled representations.},

  abstract = {Interpolated Kneser-Ney is one of the best smoothing methods for n-gram language models. Previous explanations for its superiority have been based on intuitive and empirical justifications of specific properties of the method. We propose a novel interpretation of interpolated Kneser-Ney as approximate inference in a hierarchical Bayesian model consisting of Pitman-Yor processes. As opposed to past explanations, our interpretation can recover exactly the formulation of interpolated Kneser-Ney, and performs better than interpolated Kneser-Ney when a better inference procedure is used.},

We present two self-paced reading (SPR) experiments involving Hindi that provide further evidence of antilocality, and a third SPR experiment which suggests that similarity-based interference can attenuate this distance-based facilitation. A unified explanation of interference, locality, and antilocality effects is proposed via an independently motivated theory of activation decay and retrieval interference (Anderson et al. 2004).},

Unlike prior work, we train a pruning policy under an objective that measures end-to-end performance: we search for a fast and accurate policy. This poses a difficult machine learning problem, which we tackle with the lols algorithm. lols training must continually compute the effects of changing pruning decisions: we show how to make this efficient in the constituency parsing setting, via dynamic programming and change propagation algorithms. We find that optimizing end-to-end performance in this way leads to a better Pareto frontier\textemdash i.e., parsers which are more accurate for a given runtime.},

  abstract = {A single image captures the appearance and position of multiple entities in a scene as well as their complex interactions. As a consequence, natural language grounded in visual contexts tends to be diverse \textendash{} with utterances differing as focus shifts to specific objects, interactions, or levels of detail. Recently, neural sequence models such as RNNs and LSTMs have been employed to produce visually-grounded language. Beam Search, the standard work-horse for decoding sequences from these models, is an approximate inference algorithm that decodes the top-B sequences in a greedy left-to-right fashion. In practice, the resulting sequences are often minor rewordings of a common utterance, failing to capture the multimodal nature of source images. To address this shortcoming, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), a diversity promoting alternative to BS for approximate inference. DBS produces sequences that are significantly different from each other by incorporating diversity constraints within groups of candidate sequences during decoding; moreover, it achieves this with minimal computational or memory overhead. We demonstrate that our method improves both diversity and quality of decoded sequences over existing techniques on two visually-grounded language generation tasks \textendash{} image captioning and visual question generation \textendash{} particularly on complex scenes containing diverse visual content. We also show similar improvements at language-only machine translation tasks, highlighting the generality of our approach.},

  abstract = {The experimental phenomenon known as `probability matching' is often offered as evidence in support of adaptive learning models and against the idea that people maximise their expected utility. Recent interest in dynamic-based equilibrium theories means the term re-appears in Economics. However, there seems to be conflicting views on what is actually meant by the term and about the validity of the data. The purpose of this paper is therefore threefold: First, to introduce today's readers to what is meant by probability matching, and in particular to clarify which aspects of this phenomenon challenge the utility-maximisation hypothesis. Second, to familiarise the reader with the different theoretical approaches to behaviour in such circumstances, and to focus on the differences in predictions between these theories in light of recent advances. Third, to provide a comprehensive survey of repeated, binary choice experiments.},

  abstract = {An edge-weighted tree is called ultrametric if the distances from the root to all the leaves in the tree are equal. For an n by n distance matrix M, the minimum ultrametric tree for M is an ultrametric tree T = (V, E, w) with leaf set \{1,..., n\} such that dT(i, j) {$\geq$} M[i, j] for all i, j and \$\$\textbackslash sum \{\_\{e \textbackslash in E\} w(e)\}\$\$is minimum, where dT(i, j) is the distance between i and j on T. Constructing minimum ultrametric trees from distance matrices is an important problem in computational biology. In this paper, we examine its computational complexity and approximability. When the distances satisfy the triangle inequality, we show that the minimum ultrametric tree problem can be approximated in polynomial time with error ratio 1.5(1 + {$\lceil$}log n{$\rceil$}), where n is the number of species. We also develop an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm for constructing the minimum ultrametric tree for both metric and non-metric inputs. The experimental results show that it can find an optimal solution for 25 species within reasonable time, while, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of algorithms solving the problem even for 12 species.},
