  abstract = {In a sampling problem, we are given an input x∈\{0,1\}n, and asked to sample approximately from a probability distribution \$\textbackslash mathcal\{D\}\_\{x\}\$over \$\textbackslash operatorname\{poly\} ( n ) \$-bit strings. In a search problem, we are given an input x∈\{0,1\}n, and asked to find a member of a nonempty set Axwith high probability. (An example is finding a Nash equilibrium.) In this paper, we use tools from Kolmogorov complexity to show that sampling and search problems are “essentially equivalent.” More precisely, for any sampling problem S, there exists a search problem RSsuch that, if \$\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\$is any “reasonable” complexity class, then RSis in the search version of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\$if and only if S is in the sampling version. What makes this nontrivial is that the same RSworks for every~\$\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}\$.},

  abstract = {We present a method for calculating lower bounds on the space required and local ambiguities entailed by parsing strategies. A fast, compact natural language parser must implement a strategy with low space requirements and few local ambiguities. It is also widely assumed in the psycholinguistics literature that extremely limited short-term space is available to the human parser, and that sentences containing center-embedded constructions are incomprehensible because processing them requires more space than is available. However, we show that the parsing strategies most psycholinguists assume require less space for processing center-embedded constructions than for processing other perfectly comprehensible constructions. We present alternative strategies for which center-embedded constructions do require more space than other constructions.},

Forster (2004) argued that such effects are linear in rank frequency, consistent with a serial search model of lexical access. In this article, the authors (a) describe a method of testing models of such effects that takes into account the possibility of parametric overfitting; (b) illustrate the effect of corpus choice on estimates of rank frequency; (c) give derivations of nine functional forms as predictions of models of lexical decision; (d) detail the assessment of these models and the rank model against existing data regarding the functional form of frequency effects; and (e) report further assessments using contextual diversity, a factor confounded with word frequency. The relationship between the occurrence distribution of words and lexical decision latencies to those words does not appear compatible with the rank hypothesis, undermining the case for serial search models of lexical access. Three transformations of contextual diversity based on extensions of instance models do, however, remain as plausible explanations of the effect.

  abstract = {We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. Because the transition distribution is a conditional distribution generally involving a small move, it has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by back-propagation. The theorems provided here generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising auto-encoders and provide an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood (along with defining an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism, even when the conditionals are not consistent). We study how GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. Successful experiments are conducted, validating these theoretical results, on two image datasets and with a particular architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining.},

The distractor objects included a cohort competitor with a name that began with the same onset and vowel as the name of the target object (e.g.,beetle), a rhyme competitor (e.g.speaker), and an unrelated competitor (e.g.,carriage). In Experiment 1, there was clear evidence for both cohort and rhyme activation as predicted by continuous mapping models such as TRACE (McClelland and Elman, 1986) and Shortlist (Norris, 1994). Additionally, the time course and probabilities of eye movements closely corresponded to response probabilities derived from TRACE simulations using the Luce choice rule (Luce, 1959). In the gating task, which emphasizes word-initial information, there was clear evidence for multiple activation of cohort members, as measured by judgments and eye movements, but no suggestion of rhyme effects. Given that the same sets of pictures were present during the gating task as in Experiment 1, we conclude that the rhyme effects in Experiment 1 were not an artifact of using a small set of visible alternatives.},

Whilst viewing this scene, they heard sentences such as ‘the boy will move the cake’ or ‘the boy will eat the cake’. The cake was the only edible object portrayed in the scene. In each of two experiments, the onset of saccadic eye movements to the target object (the cake) was significantly later in the move condition than in the eat condition; saccades to the target were launched after the onset of the spoken word cake in the move condition, but before its onset in the eat condition. The results suggest that information at the verb can be used to restrict the domain within the context to which subsequent reference will be made by the (as yet unencountered) post-verbal grammatical object. The data support a hypothesis in which sentence processing is driven by the predictive relationships between verbs, their syntactic arguments, and the real-world contexts in which they occur.},

The set of all the Boltzmann machines with a fixed topology forms a geometric manifold of high dimension, where modifiable synaptic weights of connections play the role of a coordinate system to specify networks. A learning trajectory, for example, is a curve in this manifold. It is important to study the geometry of the neural manifold, rather than the behavior of a single network, in order to know the capabilities and limitations of neural networks of a fixed topology. Using the new theory of information geometry, a natural invariant Riemannian metric and a dual pair of affine connections on the Boltzmann neural network manifold are established. The meaning of geometrical structures is elucidated from the stochastic and the statistical point of view. This leads to a natural modification of the Boltzmann machine learning rule.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Can the output of human cognition be predicted from the assumption that it is an optimal response to the information-processing demands of the environment? A methodology called rational analysis is described for deriving predictions about cognitive phenomena using optimization assumptions. The predictions flow from the statistical structure of the environment and not the assumed structure of the mind. Bayesian inference is used, assuming that people start with a weak prior model of the world which they integrate with experience to develop stronger models of specific aspects of the world. Cognitive performance maximizes the difference between the expected gain and cost of mental effort. (1) Memory performance can be predicted on the assumption that retrieval seeks a maximal trade-off between the probability of finding the relevant memories and the effort required to do so; in (2) categorization performance there is a similar trade-off between accuracy in predicting object features and the cost of hypothesis formation; in (3) casual inference the trade-off is between accuracy in predicting future events and the cost of hypothesis formation; and in (4) problem solving it is between the probability of achieving goals and the cost of both external and mental problem-solving search. The implemention of these rational prescriptions in neurally plausible architecture is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Availability of human memories for specific items shows reliable relationships to frequency, recency, and pattern of prior exposures to the item. These relationships have defied a systematic theoretical treatment. A number of environmental sources (New York Times, parental speech, electronic mail) are examined to show that the probability that a memory will be needed also shows reliable relationships to frequency, recency, and pattern of prior exposures. Moreover, the environmental relationships are the same as the memory relationships. It is argued that human memory has the form it does because it is adapted to these environmental relationships. Models for both the environment and human memory are described. Among the memory phenomena addressed are the practice function, the retention function, the effect of spacing of practice, and the relationship between degree of practice and retention.},

  abstract = {The ACT-R theory (Anderson, 1993; Anderson \& Lebiere, 1998) is applied to the list memory paradigms of serial recall, recognition memory, free recall, and implicit memory. List memory performance in ACT-R is determined by the level of activation of declarative chunks which encode that items occur in the list. This level of activation is in turn determined by amount of rehearsal, delay, and associative fan from a list node. This theory accounts for accuracy and latency profiles in backward and forward serial recall, set size effects in the Sternberg paradigm, length–strength effects in recognition memory, the Tulving–Wiseman function, serial position, length and practice effects in free recall, and lexical priming in implicit memory paradigms. This wide variety of effects is predicted with minimal parameter variation. It is argued that the strength of the ACT-R theory is that it offers a completely specified processing architecture that serves to integrate many existing models in the literature.},

During training, LMs have access only to text of these documents, with no direct evidence of the internal states of the agents that produced them—a fact often used to argue that LMs are incapable of modeling goal-directed aspects of human language production and comprehension. Can LMs trained on text learn anything at all about the relationship between language and use? I argue that LMs are models of communicative intentions in a specific, narrow sense. When performing next word prediction given a textual context, an LM can infer and represent properties of an agent likely to have produced that context. These representations can in turn influence subsequent LM generation in the same way that agents' communicative intentions influence their language. I survey findings from the recent literature showing that—even in today's non-robust and error-prone models—LMs infer and use representations of fine-grained communicative intentions and high-level beliefs and goals. Despite the limited nature of their training data, they can thus serve as building blocks for systems that communicate and act intentionally.},

Low frequency TL words were responded to less accurately than control words in the naming but not the lexical decision task. Experiment 2 replicated the naming data of Experiment 1 and also revealed that naming accuracy for TL word targets was reduced when they were preceded by a brief masked presentation of their confusable mate. Experiment 3 provided a third replication of the impaired naming performance for TL target words and demonstrated that the effect was insensitive to concurrent dual task demands. These TL confusability effects provide strong constraints that can contribute to evaluation and specification of current models of visual word recognition.}

Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a Lévy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

  abstract = {Humans exhibit garden path effects: When reading sentences that are temporarily structurally ambiguous, they slow down when the structure is disambiguated in favor of the less preferred alternative. Surprisal theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), a prominent explanation of this finding, proposes that these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each of the words that occur in these sentences. Challenging this hypothesis, van Schijndel and Linzen (2021) find that estimates of the cost of word predictability derived from language models severely underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects. In this work, we consider whether this underestimation is due to the fact that humans weight syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than language models do. We propose a method for estimating syntactic predictability from a language model, allowing us to weigh the cost of lexical and syntactic predictability independently. We find that treating syntactic predictability independently from lexical predictability indeed results in larger estimates of garden path. At the same time, even when syntactic predictability is independently weighted, surprisal still greatly underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects. Our results support the hypothesis that predictability is not the only factor responsible for the processing cost associated with garden path sentences.}

  abstract = {Languages are governed by syntactic constraints — structural rules that determine which sentences are grammatical in the language. In English, one such constraint is subject-verb agreement, which dictates that the number of a verb must match the number of its corresponding subject: “the dogs run”, but “the dog runs”. While this constraint appears to be simple, in practice speakers make a substantial number of agreement errors, especially if a noun phrase near the verb differs in number from the subject (for example, a speaker might produce the ungrammatical sentence “the key to the cabinets are rusty”). This phenomenon, referred to as agreement attraction, is sensitive to a wide range of properties of the sentence; no single existing model is able to generate predictions for the wide variety of materials studied in the human experimental literature. We explore the viability of neural network language models—broad-coverage systems trained to predict the next word in a corpus—as a framework for addressing this limitation. We analyze the agreement errors made by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and compare them to those of humans. The models successfully simulate certain results, such as the so-called number asymmetry and the difference between attraction strength in grammatical and ungrammatical sentences, but failed to simulate others, such as the effect of syntactic distance or notional (conceptual) number. We further evaluate networks trained with explicit syntactic supervision, and find that this form of supervision does not always lead to more human-like syntactic behavior. Finally, we show that the corpus used to train a network significantly affects the pattern of agreement errors produced by the network, and discuss the strengths and limitations of neural networks as a tool for understanding human syntactic processing.},

In this paper, we postulate that ``human-like'' generations usually lie in a narrow and nearly flat entropy band, and violation of these entropy bounds correlates with degenerate behavior. Our experiments show that this stable narrow entropy zone exists across models, tasks, and domains and confirm the hypothesis that violations of this zone correlate with degeneration. We then use this insight to propose an entropy-aware decoding algorithm that respects these entropy bounds resulting in less degenerate, more contextual, and "human-like" language generation in open-ended text generation settings.},

Unlike in large sample approximations, the posteriors are generally non-Gaussian and no Hessian needs to be computed. Predictive quantities are obtained analytically. The resulting algorithm generalizes the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm, and its convergence is guaranteed. We demonstrate that this approach can be applied to a large class of models in several domains, including mixture models and source separation.},

Two such measures, surprisal and next-word entropy, suffer from shortcomings when employed for a predictive processing view. We propose a novel metric, lookahead information gain, that can overcome these short-comings. We estimate the different measures using probabilistic language models. Subsequently, we put them to the test by analysing how well the estimated measures predict human processing effort in three data sets of naturalistic sentence reading. Our results replicate the well known effect of surprisal on word reading effort, but do not indicate a role of next-word entropy or lookahead information gain. Our computational results suggest that, in a predictive processing system, the costs of predicting may outweigh the gains. This idea poses a potential limit to the value of a predictive mechanism for the processing of language. The result illustrates the unresolved problem of finding estimations of word-by-word prediction that, first, are truly independent of perceptual processing of the to-be-predicted words, second, are statistically reliable predictors of experimental data, and third, can be derived from more general assumptions about the cognitive processes involved.},

  abstract = {This paper explores two related factors which influence variation in duration, prosodic structure and redundancy in spontaneous speech. We argue that the constraint of producing robust communication while efficiently expending articulatory effort leads to an inverse relationship between language redundancy and duration. The inverse relationship improves communication robustness by spreading information more evenly across the speech signal, yielding a smoother signal redundancy profile.We argue that prosodic prominence is a linguistic means of achieving smooth signal redundancy. Prosodic prominence increases syllable duration and coincides to a large extent with unpredictable sections of speech, and thus leads to a smoother signal redundancy.The results of linear regressions carried out between measures of redundancy, syllable duration and prosodic structure in a large corpus of spontaneous speech confirm: (1) an inverse relationship between language redundancy and duration, and (2) a strong relationship between prosodic prominence and duration.The fact that a large proportion of the variance predicted by language redundancy and prosodic prominence is nonunique suggests that, in English, prosodic prominence structure is the means with which constraints caused by a robust signal requirement are expressed in spontaneous speech.},

The sample size crucially determines a great many measures that have been proposed as characteristic text constants. However, the values of these measures change systematically as a function of the sample size. Similarly, the parameters of many models for word frequency distribution are highly dependent on the sample size.

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

We propose an observer-dependent computational theory of surprise where surprise is defined by the relative entropy between the prior and the posterior distributions of an observer. Surprise requires integration over the space of models in contrast with Shannon’s entropy, which requires integration over the space of data. We show how surprise can be computed exactly in a number of discrete and continuous cases using distributions from the exponential family with conjugate priors. We show that during sequential Bayesian learning, surprise decreases like 1/N and study how surprise differs and complements Shannon’s definition of information.},

  abstract = {The amount of information contained in a piece of data can be measured by the effect this data has on its observer. Fundamentally, this effect is to transform the observer’s prior beliefs into posterior beliefs, according to Bayes theorem. Thus the amount of information can be measured in a natural way by the distance (relative entropy) between the prior and posterior distributions of the observer over the available space of hypotheses. This facet of information, termed “surprise”, is important in dynamic situations where beliefs change, in particular during learning and adaptation. Surprise can often be computed analytically, for instance in the case of distributions from the exponential family, or it can be numerically approximated. During sequential Bayesian learning, surprise decreases as the inverse of the number of training examples. Theoretical properties of surprise are discussed, in particular how it differs and complements Shannon’s definition of information. A computer vision neural network architecture is then presented capable of computing surprise over images and video stimuli. Hypothesizing that surprising data ought to attract natural or artificial attention systems, the output of this architecture is used in a psychophysical experiment to analyze human eye movements in the presence of natural video stimuli. Surprise is found to yield robust performance at predicting human gaze (ROC-like ordinal dominance score ∼0.7 compared to ∼0.8 for human inter-observer repeatability, ∼0.6 for simpler intensity contrast-based predictor, and 0.5 for chance). The resulting theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.},

Given an input text with masked tokens, we rely on conventional masks to learn inter-relations between corrupted tokens and context via autoencoding, and pseudo masks to learn intra-relations between masked spans via partially autoregressive modeling. With well-designed position embeddings and self-attention masks, the context encodings are reused to avoid redundant computation. Moreover, conventional masks used for autoencoding provide global masking information, so that all the position embeddings are accessible in partially autoregressive language modeling. In addition, the two tasks pre-train a unified language model as a bidirectional encoder and a sequence-to-sequence decoder, respectively. Our experiments show that the unified language models pre-trained using PMLM achieve new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language understanding and generation tasks across several widely used benchmarks.},

  abstract = {After an introductory and an historical note, an elementary problem of simple qualitative inspection of a box of components is treated by using a “lattice diagram representation.” This leads to the consideration of sequential tests for such cases. Procedures for determining “Target-Handicap” forms of inspection, and their operating and sample size properties are given. This leads to a consideration of general linear sequential tests, which are those test procedures which can be formulated in terms of a “score.” Such procedures are shown to be similar to classical games of chance, and to physical diffusion processes. The diffusion analogy leads to a differential equation which gives the approximate characteristics of any such linear test. In many cases, Wald's “Probability Ratio Sequential Test” takes the form of a linear test. The conditions for this are determined. The P.R.S. test is seen to be “best possible linear test,” in the sense of minimizing average sample size. The effects of deviations from normality, and general distributions are considered. Reference is made to Wald's work on tests which involve parameters other than those being estimated, and then consideration is restricted to tests for the mean of normal populations where the variance is unknown. Methods of reducing such tests to simple binomial tests are indicated. A number of procedures for use with 2 × 2 comparative trials, and double dichotomies, are given, and their properties discussed. Returning to general inspection problems, the paper indicates that these are not always to be identified with problems involving merely tests of statistical hypotheses. The notions of Consumer's Lot, Producer's Batch, the Lot Quality Curve, the Process Curve, are explained, and their importance indicated. A distinction is made between Acceptance Inspection schemes and Rectifying Inspection schemes, and the notions of Operating Characteristic Curve, Operating Characteristic Matrix, and the Sample Size distribution function are explained. The lattice diagram is used to bring out relationships between notions involved in general inspection, and some other uses are also indicated. Finally, some reflections on the relevance of the matters discussed to matters of current debate among statisticians are given.},

This is illustrated by failures to notice the anomaly in questions such as, “When an airplane crashes, where should the survivors be buried?” Four experiments were carried out to extend knowledge of what determines the incidental detection of the critical item. Detection is a function of the goodness of global fit of the item (Experiments 1 and 2) and the extent to which the scenario predicts the item (Experiment 3). Global good fit appears to result in shallow processing of details. In Experiment 4, it is shown that if satisfactory coherence can be established without detailed semantic analysis, through the recruitment of suitable information from a sentence, then processing is indeed shallow. The studies also show that a text is not understood by first producing a local semantic representation and then incorporating this into a global model, and that semantic processing is not strictly incremental.},

  abstract = {Efficient data compression is essential for capacity-limited systems, such as biological perception and perceptual memory. We hypothesize that the need for efficient compression shapes biological systems in many of the same ways that it shapes engineered systems. If true, then the tools that engineers use to analyze and design systems, namely rate-distortion theory (RDT), can profitably be used to understand human perception and memory. The first portion of this article discusses how three general principles for efficient data compression provide accounts for many important behavioral phenomena and experimental results. We also discuss how these principles are embodied in RDT. The second portion notes that exact RDT methods are computationally feasible only in low-dimensional stimulus spaces. To date, researchers have used deep neural networks to approximately implement RDT in high-dimensional spaces, but these implementations have been limited to tasks in which the sole goal is compression with respect to reconstruction error. Here, we introduce a new deep neural network architecture that approximately implements RDT. An important property of our architecture is that it is trained “end-to-end,” operating on raw perceptual input (e.g., pixel values) rather than intermediate levels of abstraction, as is the case with most psychological models. The article’s final portion conjectures on how efficient compression can occur in memory over time, thereby providing motivations for multiple memory systems operating at different time scales, and on how efficient compression may explain some attentional phenomena such as RTs in visual search.},

A useful sequential test which we term the MSPRT is studied in this paper. The test is shown to be a generalization of the sequential probability ratio test. Under Bayesian assumptions, it is argued that the MSPRT approximates the much more complicated optimal test when error probabilities are small and expected stopping times are large. Bounds on error probabilities are derived, and asymptotic expressions for the stopping time and error probabilities are given. A design procedure is presented for determining the parameters of the MSPRT. Two examples involving Gaussian densities are included, and comparisons are made between simulation results and asymptotic expressions. Comparisons with Bayesian fixed sample size tests are also made, and it is found that the MSPRT requires two to three times fewer samples on average.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Fluctuations in strategy, attention, or motivation can cause large variability in performance across task trials. Typically, this variability is treated as noise, and assumed to cancel out, leaving supposedly stable relationships among behavior, neural activity, and experimental task conditions. Those relationships, however, could change with a participant’s internal cognitive states, and variability in performance may carry important information regarding those states, which cannot be directly measured. Therefore, we used a mathematical, state-space modeling framework to estimate internal states from measured behavioral data, quantifying each participant’s sensitivity to factors such as past errors or distractions, to predict their reaction time fluctuations. We show how modeling these states greatly improves trial-by-trial prediction of behavior. Further, we identify EEG functional connectivity features that modulate with each state. These results illustrate the potential of this approach and how it could enable quantification of intra- and inter-individual differences and provide insight into their neural bases. Statement of Relevance Cognitive behavioral performance and its neural bases vary both across individuals and within individuals over time. Understanding this variability may be key to the success of clinical or educational interventions. Internal cognitive states reflecting differences in strategy, attention, and motivation may drive much of these inter- and intra-individual differences, but often cannot be reliably controlled or measured in cognitive neuroscience research. The mathematical modeling framework developed here uses measured data to estimate a participant’s dynamic, internal cognitive states, with each state derived from specific factors hypothesized to affect attention, motivation or strategy. The results highlight potential sources of behavioral variability and reveal EEG features that modulate with each state. Our method quantifies and characterizes individual behavioral differences and highlights their underlying neural mechanisms, which could be used for future targeted training or neuromodulation therapies to improve cognitive performance.},

To do so, we train an affine probe for each block in a frozen pretrained model, making it possible to decode every hidden state into a distribution over the vocabulary. Our method, the \textbackslash emph\{tuned lens\}, is a refinement of the earlier ``logit lens'' technique, which yielded useful insights but is often brittle. We test our method on various autoregressive language models with up to 20B parameters, showing it to be more predictive, reliable and unbiased than the logit lens. With causal experiments, we show the tuned lens uses similar features to the model itself. We also find the trajectory of latent predictions can be used to detect malicious inputs with high accuracy.

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

  abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a Markov chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution.  Because the transition distribution is a conditional distribution generally involving a small move, it has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by backprop. The theorems provided here generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising autoencoders and provide an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood (along with defining an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism, even when the conditionals are not consistent). GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest.  Successful experiments are conducted, validating these theoretical results, on two image datasets and with a particular architecture that mimics the Deep Boltzmann Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining.},

  abstract = {Behavioral data obtained with perceptual decision making experiments are typically analyzed with the drift-diffusion model. This parsimonious model accumulates noisy pieces of evidence toward a decision bound to explain the accuracy and reaction times of subjects. Recently, Bayesian models have been proposed to explain how the brain extracts information from noisy input as typically presented in perceptual decision making tasks. It has long been known that the drift-diffusion model is tightly linked with such functional Bayesian models but the precise relationship of the two mechanisms was never made explicit. Using a Bayesian model, we derived the equations which relate parameter values between these models. In practice we show that this equivalence is useful when fitting multi-subject data. We further show that the Bayesian model suggests different decision variables which all predict equal responses and discuss how these may be discriminated based on neural correlates of accumulated evidence. In addition, we discuss extensions to the Bayesian model which would be difficult to derive for the drift-diffusion model. We suggest that these and other extensions may be highly useful for deriving new experiments which test novel hypotheses.},

  abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

This superficially simple syntactic operation is regularly implemented by speakers, but occasionally derails in sentences such as The cost of the improvements have not yet been estimated. We examined whether the incidence of such errors was related to the presence of subject-like semantic features in the immediate preverbal nouns, in light of current questions about the semantic versus syntactic nature of sentence subjects and the interactivity of language processing. In three experiments, speakers completed sentence fragments designed to elicit erroneous agreement. We varied the number and animacy of the head noun and the immediate preverbal (local) noun, as well as the amount of material separating the head noun from the verb. The plurality of the local noun phrase had a large and reliable effect on the incidence of agreement errors, but neither its animacy nor its length affected their occurrence. The latter findings suggest, respectively, that the semantic features of sentence subjects are of minimal relevance to the syntactic and morphological processes that implement agreement, and that agreement features are specified at a point in processing where the eventual length of sentential constituents has little effect on syntactic planning. Both results follow naturally from explanations of language production that emphasize the segregation of sentence formulation processes into relatively autonomous components.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an easy to follow tutorial on the free-energy framework for modelling perception developed by Friston, which extends the predictive coding model of Rao and Ballard. These models assume that the sensory cortex infers the most likely values of attributes or features of sensory stimuli from the noisy inputs encoding the stimuli. Remarkably, these models describe how this inference could be implemented in a network of very simple computational elements, suggesting that this inference could be performed by biological networks of neurons. Furthermore, learning about the parameters describing the features and their uncertainty is implemented in these models by simple rules of synaptic plasticity based on Hebbian learning. This tutorial introduces the free-energy framework using very simple examples, and provides step-by-step derivations of the model. It also discusses in more detail how the model could be implemented in biological neural circuits. In particular, it presents an extended version of the model in which the neurons only sum their inputs, and synaptic plasticity only depends on activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons.},

  abstract = {AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

  abstract = {The surprisal of a word on a probabilistic grammar constitutes a promising complexity metric for human sentence comprehension difficulty. Using two different grammar types, surprisal is shown to have an effect on fixation durations and regression probabilities in a sample of German readers’ eye movements, the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. A linear mixed-effects model was used to quantify the effect of surprisal while taking into account unigram frequency and bigram frequency (transitional probability), word length, and empirically-derived word predictability; the socalled “early” and “late” measures of processing difficulty both showed an effect of surprisal. Surprisal is also shown to have a small but statistically non-significant effect on empirically-derived predictability itself. This work thus demonstrates the importance of including parsing costs as a predictor of comprehension difficulty in models of reading, and suggests that a simple identification of syntactic parsing costs with early measures and late measures with durations of post-syntactic events may be difficult to uphold.},

  abstract = {This open access book introduces a general framework that allows natural language researchers to enhance existing competence theories with fully specified performance and processing components. Gradually developing increasingly complex and cognitively realistic competence-performance models, it provides running code for these models and shows how to fit them to real-time experimental data. This computational cognitive modeling approach opens up exciting new directions for research in formal semantics, and linguistics more generally, and offers new ways of (re)connecting semantics and the broader field of cognitive science. The approach of this book is novel in more ways than one. Assuming the mental architecture and procedural modalities of Anderson’s ACT-R framework, it presents fine-grained computational models of human language processing tasks which make detailed quantitative predictions that can be checked against the results of self-paced reading and other psycho-linguistic experiments. All models are presented as computer programs that readers can run on their own computer and on inputs of their choice, thereby learning to design, program and run their own models. But even for readers who won't do all that, the book will show how such detailed, quantitatively predicting modeling of linguistic processes is possible. A methodological breakthrough and a must for anyone concerned about the future of linguistics! (Hans Kamp) This book constitutes a major step forward in linguistics and psycholinguistics. It constitutes a unique synthesis of several different research traditions: computational models of psycholinguistic processes, and formal models of semantics and discourse processing. The work also introduces a sophisticated python-based software environment for modeling linguistic processes. This book has the potential to revolutionize not only formal models of linguistics, but also models of language processing more generally. (Shravan Vasishth)},

  abstract = {Bounded rationality concerns the study of decision makers with limited information processing resources. Previously, the free energy difference functional has been suggested to model bounded rational decision making, as it provides a natural trade-off between an energy or utility function that is to be optimized and information processing costs that are measured by entropic search costs. The main question of this article is how the information-theoretic free energy model relates to simple ε-optimality models of bounded rational decision making, where the decision maker is satisfied with any action in an ε-neighborhood of the optimal utility. We find that the stochastic policies that optimize the free energy trade-off comply with the notion of ε-optimality. Moreover, this optimality criterion even holds when the environment is adversarial. We conclude that the study of bounded rationality based on ε-optimality criteria that abstract away from the particulars of the information processing constraints is compatible with the information-theoretic free energy model of bounded rationality.},

  abstract = {During language comprehension, we routinely use information from the prior context to help identify the meaning of individual words. While measures of online processing difficulty, such as reading times, are strongly influenced by contextual predictability, there is disagreement about the mechanisms underlying this lexical predictability effect, with different models predicting different linking functions – linear (Reichle, Rayner, \& Pollatsek, 2003) or logarithmic (Levy, 2008). To help resolve this debate, we conducted two highly-powered experiments (self-paced reading, N = 216; cross-modal picture naming, N = 36), and a meta-analysis of prior eye-tracking while reading studies (total N = 218). We observed a robust linear relationship between lexical predictability and word processing times across all three studies. Beyond their methodological implications, these findings also place important constraints on predictive processing models of language comprehension. In particular, these results directly contradict the empirical predictions of surprisal theory, while supporting a proportional pre-activation account of lexical prediction effects in comprehension.},

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

We first show that the assumptions of such analyses—such as t-tests, ANOVAs, and linear mixed-effects models—are neither consistently met by raw RTs, nor by log-transformed RTs (or any other common power transforms, incl. inverse-transformed RTs). Only a non-power transform (log-shift) provides a decent fit for all data sets and data preparation steps we consider. We then compare the statistical power and Type I error rate for linear mixed-effects models over raw or log-transformed RTs. Previous studies on this matter relied on parametrically generated data. We show why this is problematic, and introduce as an alternative a hierarchical bootstrap approach over naturally distributed reading times. This approach yields substantially different—and arguably more informative—results than the parametric simulation approaches we compare it to. Our results suggests that it is time to heed the advice others have provided for reading research: for any but the simplest designs, we find both the rate of spurious significances and the rate of undetected true effects can strongly depend on the scale (e.g., raw or log-RTs) in which effects are assumed to be linear. Researchers should thus clearly motivate the choice of analysis based on theoretical grounds, assess the robustness of findings under different analysis approaches, and discuss potential mismatches between analyses. The R scripts and libraries shared in the accompanying OSF repo allow researchers to assess the reliability of their analyses via hierarchical bootstrap over their own data.},

  abstract = {The variational autoencoder (VAE; Kingma, Welling (2014)) is a recently proposed generative model pairing a top-down generative network with a bottom-up recognition network which approximates posterior inference. It typically makes strong assumptions about posterior inference, for instance that the posterior distribution is approximately factorial, and that its parameters can be approximated with nonlinear regression from the observations. As we show empirically, the VAE objective can lead to overly simplified representations which fail to use the network's entire modeling capacity. We present the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE), a generative model with the same architecture as the VAE, but which uses a strictly tighter log-likelihood lower bound derived from importance weighting. In the IWAE, the recognition network uses multiple samples to approximate the posterior, giving it increased flexibility to model complex posteriors which do not fit the VAE modeling assumptions. We show empirically that IWAEs learn richer latent space representations than VAEs, leading to improved test log-likelihood on density estimation benchmarks.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This thesis investigates the role of linguistically-motivated generative models of syntax and semantic structure in natural language processing (NLP). Syntactic well-formedness is crucial in language generation, but most statistical models do not account for the hierarchical structure of sentences. Many applications exhibiting natural language understanding rely on structured semantic representations to enable querying, inference and reasoning. Yet most semantic parsers produce domain-specific or inadequately expressive representations.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We propose a series of generative transition-based models for dependency syntax which can be applied as both parsers and language models while being amenable to supervised or unsupervised learning. Two models are based on Markov assumptions commonly made in NLP: The first is a Bayesian model with hierarchical smoothing, the second is parameterised by feed-forward neural networks. The Bayesian model enables careful analysis of the structure of the conditioning contexts required for generative parsers, but the neural network is more accurate. As a language model the syntactic neural model outperforms both the Bayesian model and n-gram neural networks, pointing to the complementary nature of distributed and structured representations for syntactic prediction. We propose approximate inference methods based on particle filtering. The third model is parameterised by recurrent neural networks (RNNs), dropping the Markov assumptions. Exact inference with dynamic programming is made tractable here by simplifying the structure of the conditioning contexts.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We then shift the focus to semantics and propose models for parsing sentences to labelled semantic graphs. We introduce a transition-based parser which incrementally predicts graph nodes (predicates) and edges (arguments). This approach is contrasted against predicting top-down graph traversals. RNNs and pointer networks are key components in approaching graph parsing as an incremental prediction problem. The RNN architecture is augmented to condition the model explicitly on the transition system configuration. We develop a robust parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics, a linguistically-expressive framework for compositional semantics which has previously been parsed only with grammar-based approaches. Our parser is much faster than the grammar-based model, while the same approach improves the accuracy of neural Abstract Meaning Representation parsing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Neural language models typically tokenise input text into sub-word units to achieve an open vocabulary. The standard approach is to use a single canonical tokenisation at both train and test time. We suggest that this approach is unsatisfactory and may bottleneck our evaluation of language model performance. Using only the one-best tokenisation ignores tokeniser uncertainty over alternative tokenisations, which may hurt model out-of-domain performance. In this paper, we argue that instead, language models should be evaluated on their marginal likelihood over tokenisations. We compare different estimators for the marginal likelihood based on sampling, and show that it is feasible to estimate the marginal likelihood with a manageable number of samples. We then evaluate a pretrained language model on both the one-best-tokenisation and marginal perplexities, and show that the marginal perplexity can be significantly better than the one best, especially on out-of-domain data. We link this difference in perplexity to the tokeniser uncertainty as measured by tokeniser entropy. We discuss some implications of our results for language model training and evaluation, particularly with regard to tokenisation robustness.},

  abstract = {While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in many tasks, much about their inner workings remains unclear. In this study, we present novel experimental insights into the resilience of LLMs, particularly GPT-4, when subjected to extensive character-level permutations. To investigate this, we first propose the Scrambled Bench, a suite designed to measure the capacity of LLMs to handle scrambled input, in terms of both recovering scrambled sentences and answering questions given scrambled context. The experimental results indicate that most powerful LLMs demonstrate the capability akin to typoglycemia, a phenomenon where humans can understand the meaning of words even when the letters within those words are scrambled, as long as the first and last letters remain in place. More surprisingly, we found that only GPT-4 nearly flawlessly processes inputs with unnatural errors, even under the extreme condition, a task that poses significant challenges for other LLMs and often even for humans. Specifically, GPT-4 can almost perfectly reconstruct the original sentences from scrambled ones, decreasing the edit distance by 95\%, even when all letters within each word are entirely scrambled. It is counter-intuitive that LLMs can exhibit such resilience despite severe disruption to input tokenization caused by scrambled text.},

  abstract = {THE latency between the appearance of a visual target and the start of the saccadic eye movement made to look at it varies from trial to trial to an extent that is inexplicable in terms of ordinary 'physiological' processes such as synaptic delays and conduction velocities. An alternative interpretation is that it represents the time needed to decide whether a target is in fact present: decision processes are necessarily stochastic, because they depend on extracting information from noisy sensory signals1. In one such model2, the presence of a target causes a signal in a decision unit to rise linearly at a rate r from its initial value s0 until it reaches a fixed threshold 0, when a saccade is initiated. One can regard this decision signal as a neural estimate of the log likelihood of the hypothesis that the target is present, the threshold being the significance criterion or likelihood level at which the target is presumed to be present. Experiments manipulating the prior probability of the target's appearing confirm this notion: the latency distribution then changes in the way expected if s0 simply reflects the prior log likelihood of the stimulus.},

Higher levels of neighborhood density produced an inhibitory trend in the progressive-demasking task, facilitation in lexical decision (significant only when neighborhood density was blocked), and a robust facilitation effect in naming (only for words with higher frequency neighbors).

The decision-theoretic structure incorporates both linear and nonlinear design problems and it suggests possible new directions to the experimental design problem, motivated by the use of new utility functions. We show that, in some special cases of linear design problems, Bayesian solutions change in a sensible way when the prior distribution and the utility function are modified to allow for the specific structure of the experiment. The decision-theoretic approach also gives a mathematical justification for selecting the appropriate optimality criterion.},

The softmax layer produces the distribution based on the dot products of a single hidden state and the embeddings of words in the vocabulary. However, we discover that this single hidden state cannot produce all probability distributions regardless of the LM size or training data size because the single hidden state embedding cannot be close to the embeddings of all the possible next words simultaneously when there are other interfering word embeddings between them. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of this limitation both theoretically and practically. Our work not only deepens our understanding of softmax bottleneck and mixture of softmax (MoS) but also inspires us to propose multi-facet softmax (MFS) to address the limitations of MoS. Extensive empirical analyses confirm our findings and show that against MoS, the proposed MFS achieves two-fold improvements in the perplexity of GPT-2 and BERT.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions:               what to evaluate               ,               where to evaluate               , and               how to evaluate               . Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at:               https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/LLM-eval-survey},

Our algorithm relies on the observation that the latency of parallel scoring of short continuations, generated by a faster but less powerful draft model, is comparable to that of sampling a single token from the larger target model. This is combined with a novel modified rejection sampling scheme which preserves the distribution of the target model within hardware numerics. We benchmark speculative sampling with Chinchilla, a 70 billion parameter language model, achieving a 2-2.5x decoding speedup in a distributed setup, without compromising the sample quality or making modifications to the model itself.},

  abstract = {Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLM) perform unsupervised dependency parsing by maximizing bi-lexical dependence scores. However, these previous methods adopt dependence scores that are difficult to interpret. These methods cannot incorporate grammatical constraints that previous grammar-based parsing research has shown beneficial to improving parsing performance. In this work, we apply Conditional Mutual Information (CMI), an interpretable metric, to measure the bi-lexical dependence and incorporate grammatical constraints into LLM-based unsupervised parsing. We incorporate Part-Of-Speech information as a grammatical constraint at the CMI estimation stage and integrate two additional grammatical constraints at the subsequent tree decoding stage. We find that the CMI score positively correlates with syntactic dependencies and has a stronger correlation with the syntactic dependencies than baseline scores. Our experiment confirms the benefits and applicability of the proposed grammatical constraints across five languages and eight datasets. The CMI parsing model outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based models and similarly constrained grammar-based models. Our analysis reveals that the CMI model is strong in retrieving dependency relations with rich lexical interactions but is weak in retrieving relations with sparse lexical interactions, indicating a potential limitation in CMI-based unsupervised parsing methods.},

However, the role of context in written language production is far less well understood, even though a considerable proportion of the language produced by many people today is written. Here we analyze the factors predictive of English language typing times in a large, naturalistic corpus from the popular TypeRacer.com website. We find broad consistency with the major documented effects of linguistic context on spoken language production, suggesting potential modality-independence in the cognitive mechanisms underlying language production and/or similar optimization pressures on the production systems in both modalities.},

We compare the performance of our algorithm to n-gram models and the Inside-Outside algorithm in three language modeling tasks. In two of the tasks, the training data is generated by a probabilistic context-free grammar and in both tasks our algorithm outperforms the other techniques. The third task involves naturally-occurring data, and in this task our algorithm does not perform as well as n-gram models but vastly outperforms the Inside-Outside algorithm.},

  abstract = {The process of sentence comprehension must allow for the possibility of noise in the input, e.g., from speaker error, listener mishearing, or environmental noise. Consequently, semantically implausible sentences such as The girl tossed the apple the boy are often interpreted as a semantically plausible alternative (e.g., The girl tossed the apple to the boy). Previous investigations of noisy-channel comprehension have relied exclusively on paradigms with isolated sentences. Because supportive contexts alter the expectations of possible interpretations, the noisy channel framework predicts that context should encourage more inference in interpreting implausible sentences, relative to null contexts (i.e. a lack of context) or unsupportive contexts. In the present work, we tested this prediction in four types of sentence constructions: two where inference is relatively frequent (double object - prepositional object), and two where inference is rare (active-passive). We found evidence that in the two sentence types that commonly elicit inference, supportive contexts encourage noisy-channel inferences about the intended meaning of implausible sentences more than non-supportive contexts or null contexts. These results suggest that noisy-channel inference may be more pervasive in everyday language processing than previously assumed based on work with isolated sentences.},

Some researchers have taken this discontinuity as evidence of two distinct representational systems. Here, we present a mathematical derivation showing that this behaviour is an optimal representation of cardinalities under a limited informational capacity, indicating that this behaviour can emerge from a single system. Our derivation predicts how the amount of information accessible to viewers should influence the perception of quantity for both large and small sets. In a series of four preregistered experiments (N\,=\,100 each), we varied the amount of information accessible to participants in number estimation. We find tight alignment between the model and human performance for both small and large quantities, implicating efficient representation as the common origin behind key phenomena of human and animal numerical cognition.},

In the experiment reported here, participants listened to the same plausible and implausible passive and active sentences as in Ferreira (2003), answered comprehension questions, and then orally described line drawings of simple transitive actions. The descriptions were analyzed as a measure of structural priming (Bock, 1986). Question accuracy data replicated Ferreira (2003). Production data yielded an interaction: Passive descriptions were produced more often after plausible passives and implausible actives. We interpret these results as indicative of a language processor that proceeds along differentiated morphosyntactic and semantic routes. The processor may end up adjudicating between conflicting outputs from these routes by settling on a “good enough” representation that is not completely faithful to the input.

The central idea is that a nontrivial proportion of misunderstanding, misinterpretation, and miscommunication can be attributed not to random error, but instead to processing preferences of the human language processing system. In other words, the very architecture of the language processor favours certain types of processing errors because in a majority of instances, this “fast and frugal”, less effortful processing is good enough to support communication. By way of historical background, connections are made between this relatively recent facet of psycholinguistic study, other recent language processing models, and related concepts in other areas of cognitive science. Finally, the nine papers included in this special issue are introduced as representative of novel explorations of good-enough, or underspecified, language processing.},

  abstract = {When a language offers multiple options for expressing the same meaning, what principles govern a speaker's choice? Two well-known principles proposed for explaining wide-ranging speaker preference are Uniform Information Density and Availability-Based Production. Here we test the predictions of these theories in a previously uninvestigated case of speaker choice. Russian has two ways of expressing the comparative: an \textbackslash textsc\{explicit\} option (\textbackslash textit\{Ona bystree chem ja\}/She fast\{\textbackslash sc-comp\} than me\{\textbackslash sc-nom\}) and a \textbackslash textsc\{genitive\} option (\textbackslash textit\{Ona bystree menya/She fast\{\textbackslash sc-comp\} me\{\textbackslash sc-gen\}\}). We lay out several potential predictions of each theory for speaker choice in the Russian comparative construction, including effects of post-comparative word predictability, phrase length, syntactic complexity, and semantic association between the comparative adjective and subsequent noun. In a corpus study, we find that the explicit construction is used preferentially when the post-comparative noun phrase is longer, has a relative clause, and is less semantically associated with the comparative adjective. A follow-up production experiment using visual scene stimuli to elicit comparative sentences replicates the corpus finding that Russian native speakers prefer the explicit form when post-comparative phrases are longer. These findings offer no clear support for the predictions of Uniform Information Density, but are broadly supportive of Availability-Based Production, with the explicit option serving as an unreduced form that eases speakers' planning of complex or low-availability utterances.

  abstract = {While natural languages differ widely in both canonical word order and word order flexibility, their word orders still follow shared cross-linguistic statistical patterns, often attributed to functional pressures. In the effort to identify these pressures, prior work has compared real and counterfactual word orders. Yet one functional pressure has been overlooked in such investigations: The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis, which holds that information should be spread evenly throughout an utterance. Here, we ask whether a pressure for UID may have influenced word order patterns cross-linguistically. To this end, we use computational models to test whether real orders lead to greater information uniformity than counterfactual orders. In our empirical study of 10 typologically diverse languages, we find that: (i) among SVO languages, real word orders consistently have greater uniformity than reverse word orders, and (ii) only linguistically implausible counterfactual orders consistently exceed the uniformity of real orders. These findings are compatible with a pressure for information uniformity in the development and usage of natural languages.1},

We manipulated the probability distribution of one probabilistic cue, voice onset time (VOT), which differentiates word initial labial stops in English (e.g., “beach” and “peach”). Participants categorized words from distributions of VOT with wide or narrow variances. Uncertainty about word identity was measured by four-alternative forced-choice judgments and by the probability of looks to pictures. Both measures closely reflected the posterior probability of the word given the likelihood distributions of VOT, suggesting that listeners are sensitive to these distributions.},

  abstract = {The object of this paper is to show why recent research in the psychology of deductive and probabilistic reasoning does not have "bleak implications for human rationality," as has sometimes been supposed. The presence of fallacies in reasoning is evaluated by referring to normative criteria which ultimately derive their own credentials from a systematisation of the intuitions that agree with them. These normative criteria cannot be taken, as some have suggested, to constitute a part of natural science, nor can they be established by metamathematical proof. Since a theory of competence has to predict the very same intuitions, it must ascribe rationality to ordinary people.Accordingly, psychological research on this topic falls into four categories. In the first, experimenters investigate conditions under which their subjects suffer from genuine cognitive illusions. The search for explanations of such performance errors may then generate hypotheses about the ways in which the relevant information-processing mechanisms operate. In the second category, experimenters investigate circumstances in which their subjects exhibit mathematical or scientific ignorance: these are tests of the subjects' intelligence or education. In the third and fourth categories, experimenters impute a fallacy where none exists, either because they are applying the relevant normative criteria in an inappropriate way or because the normative criteria being applied are not the appropriate ones.},

  abstract = {Statistical models for parsing natural language have recently shown considerable success in broad-coverage domains. Ambiguity often leads to an input sentence having many possible parse trees; statistical approaches assign a probability to each tree, thereby ranking competing trees in order of plausibility. The probability for each candidate tree is calculated as a product of terms, each term corresponding to some sub-structure within the tree. The choice of parameterization is the choice of how to break down the tree. There are two critical questions regarding the parameterization of the problem: (1) What linguistic objects (e.g., context-free rules, parse moves) should the model's parameters be associated with? I.e., How should trees be decomposed into smaller fragments? (2) How can this choice be instantiated in a sound probabilistic model? This thesis argues that the locality of a lexical head's influence in a tree should motivate modeling choices in the parsing problem. In the final parsing models a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree. Independence assumptions then follow naturally, leading to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment. All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads. The goals of the work are two-fold. First, we aim to advance the state of the art. We report tests on Wall Street Journal text showing that the models give improved accuracy over other methods in the literature. The models recover richer representations than previous approaches, adding the complement/adjunct distinction and information regarding wh-movement. Second, we aim to increase understanding of statistical parsing models. Each parameter type is motivated through tree examples where it provides discriminative information. An empirical study of prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity is used to investigate the effectiveness of dependency parameters for ambiguity resolution. A number of parsing models are tested, and we give a breakdown of their performance on different types of construction. Finally, we give a detailed comparison of the models to others in the literature.},

The models extend methods from probabilistic context-free grammars to lexicalized grammars, leading to approaches in which a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree. Independence assumptions then lead to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, bigram lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment. All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads. The models are evaluated on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other models in the literature. To gain a better understanding of the models, we also give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall results in recovering various types of dependencies. We analyze various characteristics of the models through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples. Finally, we compare the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank, aiming to give some explanation of the difference in performance of the various models.},

The model uses probabilistic parsing techniques, which combine phrase structure, lexical category, and limited subcategory probabilities with an incremental, left-to-right “pruning” mechanism based on cascaded Markov models. The parameters of the system are established through a uniform training algorithm, which determines maximum-likelihood estimates from a parsed corpus. The probabilistic parsing mechanism enables the system to achieve good accuracy on typical, “garden-variety” language (i.e., when tested on corpora). Furthermore, the incremental probabilistic ranking of the preferred analyses during parsing also naturally explains observed human behavior for a range of garden-path structures. We do not make strong psychological claims about the specific probabilistic mechanism discussed here, which is limited by a number of practical considerations. Rather, we argue incremental probabilistic parsing models are, in general, extremely well suited to explaining this dual nature—generally good and occasionally pathological—of human linguistic performance.},

  abstract = {Researchers have recently argued that the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide new insights into longstanding debates about the role of learning and/or innateness in the development and evolution of human language. Here, we argue on two grounds that LLMs alone tell us very little about human language and cognition in terms of acquisition and evolution. First, any similarities between human language and the output of LLMs are purely functional. Borrowing the “four questions” framework from ethology, we argue that what LLMs do is superficially similar, but how they do it is not. In contrast to the rich multimodal data humans leverage in interactive language learning, LLMs rely on immersive exposure to vastly greater quantities of unimodal text data, with recent multimodal efforts built upon mappings between images and text. Second, turning to functional similarities between human language and LLM output, we show that human linguistic behavior is much broader. LLMs were designed to imitate the very specific behavior of human writing; while they do this impressively, the underlying mechanisms of these models limit their capacities for meaning and naturalistic interaction, and their potential for dealing with the diversity in human language. We conclude by emphasising that LLMs are not theories of language, but tools that may be used to study language, and that can only be effectively applied with specific hypotheses to motivate research.},

The key idea is to adapt the samples for a program P into samples for a program Q, thereby avoiding the expensive sampling computation for program Q. To enable incremental inference in probabilistic programming, our work: (i) introduces the concept of a trace translator which adapts samples from P into samples of Q, (ii) phrases this translation approach in the context of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), which gives theoretical guarantees that the adapted samples converge to the distribution induced by Q, and (iii) shows how to obtain a concrete trace translator by establishing a correspondence between the random choices of the two probabilistic programs. We implemented our approach in two different probabilistic programming systems and showed that, compared to methods that sample the program Q from scratch, incremental inference can lead to orders of magnitude increase in efficiency, depending on how closely related P and Q are.},

In this prior study participants read sentences in which a perceptually confusable preposition (at; confusable with as) or non-confusable preposition (toward) was followed by a verb more likely to appear in the syntactic structure formed by replacing at with as (e.g. tossed) or a verb that was not more likely to appear in this structure (e.g. thrown). Readers experienced processing difficulty upon fixating verbs like tossed following at, but not toward. Levy et al. argued that this suggests readers maintained uncertainty about previously fixated words’ identities. We argue that this finding has wide-ranging implications for language processing theories, and that a replication is required. On the basis of a Bayes Factor Design Analysis we conducted a replication study with 56 items and 72 participants in order to determine whether Levy et al.’s effects are replicable. Using Bayesian statistical techniques we show that in our dataset there is evidence against the existence of the interaction Levy et al. found, and thus conclude that this study is non-replicable.},

In the experiment, 60 older adults and 60 younger adults read sentences in which an early preposition was either perceptually confusable with another word (at; confusable with as) or not (toward), and in which the reading of a subsequent ambiguous verb (e.g., tossed) should be affected by the confusability of the preposition, while the reading of an unambiguous verb (e.g., thrown) should not be. This design replicated that of an earlier study conducted by Levy et al. (2009) that found evidence in favour of participants maintaining uncertainty about the confusable preposition in go-past times during natural reading. However, in our study, there was no evidence that either younger or older adults maintained uncertainty about the identity of the perceptually confusable preposition, such that there was no interaction between the preposition’s form and subsequent verb ambiguity in self-paced reading times, although we did observe a main effect of verb ambiguity. This represents a failure to replicate the effect observed by Levy et al. when using a different experimental paradigm, and we consider potential causes of our findings at both a methodological and theoretical level.},

Young (18–26~years) and older (65–87~years) adult participants read sentences which were either plausible or implausible. Crucially, readers could assign a plausible interpretation to the implausible sentences by inferring that a preposition (i.e., to) had been unintentionally omitted or included. Our results reveal that readers’ fixation locations within such sentences are associated with the likelihood of them inferring the presence or absence of this critical preposition to reach a plausible interpretation. Moreover, our older adults were more likely to make these noisy-channel inferences than the younger adults, potentially because their poorer visual processing and greater linguistic experience promote such inference-making. We propose that the present findings provide novel experimental evidence for a perceptual contribution to noisy-channel inference-making during reading.},

  abstract = {Computationally intensive decoding procedures--including search, reranking, and self-critique--can improve the quality of language model (LM) outputs in problems spanning code generation, numerical reasoning, and dialog. Existing work typically applies the same decoding procedure for every input to an LM. But not all inputs require the same amount of computation to process. Can we allocate decoding computation adaptively, using more resources to answer questions whose answers will be harder to compute? We present an approach that predicts the distribution of rewards given an input and computation budget, then allocates additional computation to inputs for which it is predicted to be most useful. We apply this approach in two decoding procedures: first, an adaptive best-of-k procedure that dynamically selects the number of samples to generate as input to a reranker; second, a routing procedure that dynamically responds to a query using a decoding procedure that is expensive but accurate, or one that is cheaper but less capable. Across a suite of programming, mathematics, and dialog tasks, we show that accurate computation-allocation procedures can be learned, and reduce computation by up to 50\% at no cost to response quality, or improve quality by up to 10\% at a fixed computational budget.},

One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways.},

We show that with the exception of lexically-determined verbs that always or never incorporate, every verb may or may not incorporate its nominal object. We analyse the incorporated version as the default structure. The non-incorporated counterpart is licensed only under particular information-structure properties. We provide evidence that noun excorporation arises whenever the verb or the object noun is focused, and in turn moves to the left periphery.},

The most influential probabilistic approach to pragmatics is the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework. In this review, I demonstrate the basic mechanics and commitments of RSA as well as some of its standard extensions, highlighting the key features that have led to its success in accounting for a wide variety of pragmatic phenomena. Fundamentally, it treats language as probabilistic, informativeness as gradient, alternatives as context-dependent, and subjective prior beliefs (world knowledge) as a crucial facet of interpretation. It also provides an integrated account of the link between production and interpretation. I highlight key challenges for RSA, which include scalability, the treatment of the boundedness of cognition, and the incremental and compositional nature of language.},

  abstract = {Autoencoder reconstructions are widely used for the task of unsupervised anomaly localization. Indeed, an autoencoder trained on normal data is expected to only be able to reconstruct normal features of the data, allowing the segmentation of anomalous pixels in an image via a simple comparison between the image and its autoencoder reconstruction. In practice however, local defects added to a normal image can deteriorate the whole reconstruction, making this segmentation challenging. To tackle the issue, we propose in this paper a new approach for projecting anomalous data on a autoencoder-learned normal data manifold, by using gradient descent on an energy derived from the autoencoder's loss function. This energy can be augmented with regularization terms that model priors on what constitutes the user-defined optimal projection. By iteratively updating the input of the autoencoder, we bypass the loss of high-frequency information caused by the autoencoder bottleneck. This allows to produce images of higher quality than classic reconstructions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on various anomaly localization datasets. It also shows promising results at an inpainting task on the CelebA dataset.},

  abstract = {Reliable generalization lies at the heart of safe ML and AI. However, understanding when and how neural networks generalize remains one of the most important unsolved problems in the field. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study (10250 models, 15 tasks) to investigate whether insights from the theory of computation can predict the limits of neural network generalization in practice. We demonstrate that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs. This includes negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never lead to any non-trivial generalization, despite models having sufficient capacity to fit the training data perfectly. Our results show that, for our subset of tasks, RNNs and Transformers fail to generalize on non-regular tasks, LSTMs can solve regular and counter-language tasks, and only networks augmented with structured memory (such as a stack or memory tape) can successfully generalize on context-free and context-sensitive tasks.},

Our results show that DLT integration cost is not a significant predictor of reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully predicts reading times for nouns. We also find evidence for integration cost effects at auxiliaries, not predicted by DLT. For surprisal, we demonstrate that an unlexicalized formulation of surprisal can predict reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. Comparing DLT integration cost and surprisal, we find that the two measures are uncorrelated, which suggests that a complete theory will need to incorporate both aspects of processing complexity. We conclude that eye-tracking corpora, which provide reading time data for naturally occurring, contextualized sentences, can complement experimental evidence as a basis for theories of processing complexity.},

Given the vast array of available models, it is of both theoretical and methodological importance to assess what features of a model influence its psychometric quality. In this work we focus on parameter size, showing that larger Transformer-based language models generate probabilistic estimates that are less predictive of early eye-tracking measurements reflecting lexical access and early semantic integration. However, relatively bigger models show an advantage in capturing late eye-tracking measurements that reflect the full semantic and syntactic integration of a word into the current language context. Our results are supported by eye movement data in ten languages and consider four models, spanning from 564M to 4.5B parameters.},

Our analyses show that predictability ratings are the best predictors of the EEG signal (N400, P600, LAN) self-paced reading times, and eye movement patterns, when spillover effects are taken into account. The computational estimates are particularly effective at explaining variance in the eye-tracking data without spillover. Cloze probability estimates have decent overall psychometric accuracy and are the best predictors of early fixation patterns (first fixation duration). Our results indicate that the choice of the best measurement of word predictability in context critically depends on the processing index being considered.},

  abstract = {Language modeling, a central task in natural language processing, involves estimating a probability distribution over strings. In most cases, the estimated distribution sums to 1 over all finite strings. However, in some pathological cases, probability mass can “leak” onto the set of infinite sequences. In order to characterize the notion of leakage more precisely, this paper offers a measure-theoretic treatment of language modeling. We prove that many popular language model families are in fact tight, meaning that they will not leak in this sense. We also generalize characterizations of tightness proposed in previous works.},

  abstract = {There have been various types of pretraining architectures including autoencoding models (e.g., BERT), autoregressive models (e.g., GPT), and encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5). However, none of the pretraining frameworks performs the best for all tasks of three main categories including natural language understanding (NLU), unconditional generation, and conditional generation. We propose a General Language Model (GLM) based on autoregressive blank infilling to address this challenge. GLM improves blank filling pretraining by adding 2D positional encodings and allowing an arbitrary order to predict spans, which results in performance gains over BERT and T5 on NLU tasks. Meanwhile, GLM can be pretrained for different types of tasks by varying the number and lengths of blanks. On a wide range of tasks across NLU, conditional and unconditional generation, GLM outperforms BERT, T5, and GPT given the same model sizes and data, and achieves the best performance from a single pretrained model with 1.25\textbackslash mbox\textbackslash times parameters of BERT Large , demonstrating its generalizability to different downstream tasks.},

Together, the first four experiments showed that listerners immediately integrated lexical, sublexical, and prosodic information in the spoken input with information from the visual context to reduce the set of referents to the intended one. The fifth experiment demonstrated that a visual referential context affected the initial structuring of the linguistic input, eliminating even strong syntactic preferences that result in clear garden paths when the referential context is introduced linguistically. We argue that context affected the earliest moments of language processing because it was highly accessible and relevant to the behavioral goals of the listener.},

We present a framework for algorithmically synthesizing models of a basic part of human language: morpho-phonology, the system that builds word forms from sounds. We integrate Bayesian inference with program synthesis and representations inspired by linguistic theory and cognitive models of learning and discovery. Across 70 datasets from 58 diverse languages, our system synthesizes human-interpretable models for core aspects of each language’s morpho-phonology, sometimes approaching models posited by human linguists. Joint inference across all 70 data sets automatically synthesizes a meta-model encoding interpretable cross-language typological tendencies. Finally, the same algorithm captures few-shot learning dynamics, acquiring new morphophonological rules from just one or a few examples. These results suggest routes to more powerful machine-enabled discovery of interpretable models in linguistics and other scientific domains.},

  abstract = {In experiments investigating sentence processing, eye movement measures such as fixation durations and regression proportions while reading are commonly used to draw conclusions about processing difficulties. However, these measures are the result of an interaction of multiple cognitive levels and processing strategies and thus are only indirect indicators of processing difficulty. In order to properly interpret an eye movement response, one has to understand the underlying principles of adaptive processing such as trade-off mechanisms between reading speed and depth of comprehension that interact with task demands and individual differences. Therefore, it is necessary to establish explicit models of the respective mechanisms as well as their causal relationship with observable behavior. There are models of lexical processing and eye movement control on the one side and models on sentence parsing and memory processes on the other. However, no model so far combines both sides with explicitly defined linking assumptions. In this thesis, a model is developed that integrates oculomotor control with a parsing mechanism and a theory of cue-based memory retrieval. On the basis of previous empirical findings and independently motivated principles, adaptive, resource-preserving mechanisms of underspecification are proposed both on the level of memory access and on the level of syntactic parsing. The thesis first investigates the model of cue-based retrieval in sentence comprehension of Lewis \& Vasishth (2005) with a comprehensive literature review and computational modeling of retrieval interference in dependency processing. The results reveal a great variability in the data that is not explained by the theory. Therefore, two principles, 'distractor prominence' and 'cue confusion', are proposed as an extension to the theory, thus providing a more adequate description of systematic variance in empirical results as a consequence of experimental design, linguistic environment, and individual differences. In the remainder of the thesis, four interfaces between parsing and eye movement control are defined: Time Out, Reanalysis, Underspecification, and Subvocalization. By comparing computationally derived predictions with experimental results from the literature, it is investigated to what extent these four interfaces constitute an appropriate elementary set of assumptions for explaining specific eye movement patterns during sentence processing. Through simulations, it is shown how this system of in itself simple assumptions results in predictions of complex, adaptive behavior.  In conclusion, it is argued that, on all levels, the sentence comprehension mechanism seeks a balance between necessary processing effort and reading speed on the basis of experience, task demands, and resource limitations. Theories of linguistic processing therefore need to be explicitly defined and implemented, in particular with respect to linking assumptions between observable behavior and underlying cognitive processes. The comprehensive model developed here integrates multiple levels of sentence processing that hitherto have only been studied in isolation. The model is made publicly available as an expandable framework for future studies of the interactions between parsing, memory access, and eye movement control.},

The predictions of the model are compared with the results of a recent meta-analysis of published reading studies on retrieval interference in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent and subject–verb dependencies (Jäger, Engelmann, \& Vasishth, 2017). The comparison shows that the model has only partial success in explaining the data; and we propose that its prediction space is restricted by oversimplifying assumptions. We then implement a revised model that takes into account differences between individual experimental designs in terms of the prominence of the target and the distractor in memory- and context-dependent cue-feature associations. The predictions of the original and the revised model are quantitatively compared with the results of the meta-analysis. Our simulations show that, compared to the original LV05 model, the revised model accounts for the data better. The results suggest that effects of prominence and variable cue-feature associations need to be considered in the interpretation of existing empirical results and in the design and planning of future experiments. With regard to retrieval interference in sentence processing and to the broader field of psycholinguistic studies, we conclude that well-specified models in tandem with high-powered experiments are needed in order to uncover the underlying cognitive processes.},

Consider the following question: How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the Ark? Most people answer “two” even though they know quite well that it was Noah and not Moses who sailed the Ark. This illusion occurs even when time pressure is eliminated and subjects are told that questions may be “wrong” and given an example of a question with an inconsistent name in it. Two explanations of this illusion—that people are skipping over the name or that the focus of the question is leading them astry—are eliminated. Results indicate that it is important that the inconsistent name share semantic featuers with the correct name. An explanation of the illusion is developed.},

  abstract = {The effects of sentential context and semantic memory structure during on-line sentence processing were examined by recording event-related brain potentials as individuals read pairs of sentences for comprehension. The first sentence established an expectation for a particular exemplar of a semantic category, while the second ended with (1) that expected exemplar, (2) an unexpected exemplar from the same (expected) category, or (3) an unexpected item from a different (unexpected) category. Expected endings elicited a positivity between 250 and 550 ms while all unexpected endings elicited an N400, which was significantly smaller to items from the expected category. This N400 reduction varied with the strength of the contextually induced expectation: unexpected, categorically related endings elicited smaller N400s in more constraining contexts, despite their poorer fit to context (lower plausibility). This pattern of effects is best explained as reflecting the impact of context-independent long-term memory structure on sentence processing. The results thus suggest that physical and functional similarities that hold between objects in the world—i.e., category structure—influence neural organization and, in turn, routine language comprehension processes.},

Results suggest that, when it can, the brain uses context to predict features of likely upcoming items. However, although prediction seems important for comprehension, it also appears susceptible to age-related deterioration and can be associated with processing costs. The brain may address this trade-off by employing multiple processing strategies, distributed across the two cerebral hemispheres. In particular, left hemisphere language processing seems to be oriented toward prediction and the use of top-down cues, whereas right hemisphere comprehension is more bottom-up, biased toward the veridical maintenance of information. Such asymmetries may arise, in turn, because language comprehension mechanisms are integrated with language production mechanisms only in the left hemisphere (the PARLO framework).},

Three experiments are summarized that were designed to investigate the reanalysis and interpretation of relatively difficult garden-path sentences (e.g., While Anna dressed the baby spit up on the bed). After reading such sentences, participants correctly believed that the baby spit up on the bed; however, they often confidently, yet incorrectly, believed that Anna dressed the baby. These results demonstrate that garden-path reanalysis is not an all-or-nothing process and that thematic roles initially assigned for the subordinate clause verb are not consistently revised. The implications of the partial reanalysis phenomenon for Fodor and Inoue's (1998) model of reanalysis and sentence processing are discussed. In addition, we discuss the possibility that language processing often creates “good enough” structures rather than ideal structures.},

Investigations of the misinterpretation of both garden-path and passive sentences have yielded support for the idea that the meaning people obtain for a sentence is often not a reflection of its true content. Moreover, incorrect interpretations may persist even after syntactic reanalysis has taken place. Our good-enough approach to language comprehension holds that language processing is sometimes only partial and that semantic representations are often incomplete.

At the same time, a number of researchers have argued that prediction plays a key role in comprehension, allowing people to anticipate features of the input and even specific upcoming words based on sentential constraint. In this chapter, we review evidence from our lab supporting both approaches, even though at least superficially these two perspectives seem incompatible. We then argue that what allows us to link good-enough processing and prediction is the concept of information structure, which states that sentences are organized to convey both given or presupposed information, and new or focused information. Our fundamental proposal is that given or presupposed information is processed in a good-enough manner, while new or focused information is the target of the comprehender's prediction efforts. The result is a theory that brings together three different literatures that have been treated almost entirely independently, and which can be evaluated using a combination of behavioral, computational, and neural methods.},

Doubts arise for a host of reasons, including a lack of transparency, ignorance, negligence, or misrepresentation of the evidence. We describe the scope of the problem and focus on how transparency is a part of the solution. A lack of measurement transparency makes it impossible to evaluate potential threats to internal, external, statistical-conclusion, and construct validity. We demonstrate that psychology is plagued by a measurement schmeasurement attitude: QMPs are common, hide a stunning source of researcher degrees of freedom, and pose a serious threat to cumulative psychological science, but are largely ignored. We address these challenges by providing a set of questions that researchers and consumers of scientific research can consider to identify and avoid QMPs. Transparent answers to these measurement questions promote rigorous research, allow for thorough evaluations of a study’s inferences, and are necessary for meaningful replication studies.},

  abstract = {Revisioned text content is present in numerous collaboration platforms on the Web, most notably Wikis. To track authorship of text tokens in such systems has many potential applications; the identification of main authors for licensing reasons or tracing collaborative writing patterns over time, to name some. In this context, two main challenges arise. First, it is critical for such an authorship tracking system to be precise in its attributions, to be reliable for further processing. Second, it has to run efficiently even on very large datasets, such as Wikipedia. As a solution, we propose a graph-based model to represent revisioned content and an algorithm over this model that tackles both issues effectively. We describe the optimal implementation and design choices when tuning it to a Wiki environment. We further present a gold standard of 240 tokens from English Wikipedia articles annotated with their origin. This gold standard was created manually and confirmed by multiple independent users of a crowdsourcing platform. It is the first gold standard of this kind and quality and our solution achieves an average of 95\% precision on this data set. We also perform a first-ever precision evaluation of the state-of-the-art algorithm for the task, exceeding it by over 10\% on average. Our approach outperforms the execution time of the state-of-the-art by one order of magnitude, as we demonstrate on a sample of over 240 English Wikipedia articles. We argue that the increased size of an optional materialization of our results by about 10\% compared to the baseline is a favorable trade-off, given the large advantage in runtime performance.},

This new edition of the widely used analysis book continues to cover real analysis in greater detail and at a more advanced level than most books on the subject. Encompassing several subjects that underlie much of modern analysis, the book focuses on measure and integration theory, point set topology, and the basics of functional analysis. It illustrates the use of the general theories and introduces readers to other branches of analysis such as Fourier analysis, distribution theory, and probability theory. This edition is bolstered in content as well as in scope-extending its usefulness to students outside of pure analysis as well as those interested in dynamical systems. The numerous exercises, extensive bibliography, and review chapter on sets and metric spaces make Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications, Second Edition invaluable for students in graduate-level analysis courses. New features include: * Revised material on the n-dimensional Lebesgue integral. * An improved proof of Tychonoffs theorem. * Expanded material on Fourier analysis. * A newly written chapter devoted to distributions and differential equations. * Updated material on Hausdorff dimension and fractal dimension.},

  abstract = {The maze task is an online measure of sentence processing time that provides an alternative to the standard moving window version of self-paced reading. Rather than each word of the sentence being presented in succession, two words are presented at the same time, and the participant must choose which word is a grammatical continuation of the sentence. This procedure forces the reader into an incremental mode of processing in which each word must be fully integrated with the preceding context before the next word can be considered. Previous research with this technique has not considered whether it is sufficiently sensitive to syntactic complexity effects or to garden path effects. Four experiments are reported demonstrating that reliable differences in processing time for subject relatives and object relatives can be obtained, and that this technique generates garden path effects that correspond closely with the data from eyetracking experiments, but without the spillover effects that are sometimes obtained with eyetracking. It is also shown that the task is sensitive to word frequency effects, producing estimates well in excess of those found with eyetracking.},

We investigate whether event-related potentials (ERPs), too, are predicted by information measures. Three types of language models estimated four different information measures on each word of a sample of English sentences. Six different ERP deflections were extracted from the EEG signal of participants reading the same sentences. A comparison between the information measures and ERPs revealed a reliable correlation between N400 amplitude and word surprisal. Language models that make no use of syntactic structure fitted the data better than did a phrase-structure grammar, which did not account for unique variance in N400 amplitude. These findings suggest that different information measures quantify cognitively different processes and that readers do not make use of a sentence’s hierarchical structure for generating expectations about the upcoming word.},

  abstract = {It is proposed that the human sentence parsing device assigns phrase structure to word strings in two steps. The first stage parser assigns lexical and phrasal nodes to substrings of roughly six words. The second stage parser then adds higher nodes to link these phrasal packages together into a complete phrase marker. This model of the parser is compared with ATN models, and with the two-stage models of Kimball (1973) and Fodor, Bever and Garrett (1974). Our assumption that the units which are shunted from the first stage to the second stage are defined by their length, rather than by their syntactic type, explains the effects of constituent length on perceptual complexity in center embedded sentences and in sentences of the kind that fall under Kimball's principle of Right Association. The particular division of labor between the two parsing units allows us to explain, without appeal to any ad hoc parsing strategies, why the parser makes certain ‘shortsighted’ errors even though, in general, it is able to make intelligent use of all the information that is available to it. Résumé Dans cet article on propose un mécanisme de segmentation des énoncés qui assigne en deux étapes une structure syntagmatique aux suites de mots. La première méthode de segmentation assigne des noeuds lexicaux et syntagmatiques à des suites de 6 mots environ. La seconde ajoute des noeuds à un niveau supérieur pour lier ces blocs syntagmatiques et obtenir ainsi un marqueur syntagmatique complet. Ce modèle de segmentation est comparé d'une part aux modèles ATN et d'autre part au modèle en deux étapes de Kimball (1973) et Fodor, Bever et Garrett (1974). Nous pensons que les unités qui passent du ler au 2è niveau sont caractérisées par leur longueur plutôt que par leur forme syntaxique. Ceci expliquerait les effects de la longueur des constituants sur la complexité perceptuelle des phrases enclassées et des phrases du type de celles qui tombent sous le principe de l'association à droite de Kimball. La distinction spécifique du travail entre les deux unités de segmentation permet d'expliquer, sans faire intervenir des stratégies ad hoc, certaines erreurs de segmentation même si, en général, il est possible de faire un usage intelligent de toutes les informations disponibles.},

  abstract = {Advances in research on language processing have originally come from group-level comparisons, but there is now a growing interest in individual differences. To investigate individual differences, tasks that have shown robust group-level differences are often used with the implicit assumption that they will also be reliable when used as an individual differences measure. Here, we examined whether one of the primary tasks used in psycholinguistic research on language processing, the self-paced reading task, can reliably measure individual differences in relative clause processing. We replicated the well-established effects of relative clauses at the group level, with object relative clauses being more difficult to process than subject relative clauses. However, when using difference scores, the reliability of the size of the relative clause effect was close to zero because the self-paced reading times for the different relative clause types were highly correlated within individuals. Nonetheless, we found that the self-paced reading task can be used to reliably capture individual differences in overall reading speed as well as key sentence regions when the two types of relative clause sentences are considered separately. Our results indicate that both the reliability and validity of different sentence regions need to be assessed to determine whether and when self-paced reading can be used to examine individual differences in language processing.},

  abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation. By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts. It turns out that the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning) can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain's free energy, as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses can be seen as the brains attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered. The underlying scheme rests on empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical perspective. In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically, that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory). In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psychophysical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with the MMN and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a free energy principle that tries to explain the ability of biological systems to resist a natural tendency to disorder. It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.},

Furthermore, such errors reveal that linguistic performance is highly rule-governed, and that in many cases it is grammatical rules which constrain or monitor actual speech production. While a model of linguistic competence is independent of temporal constraints, a model of linguistic performance must provide information as to the sequencing of events in real time.

  abstract = {The sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) task aims at generating the target sequence based on the given input source sequence. Traditionally, most of the seq2seq task is resolved by the Encoder-Decoder framework which requires an encoder to encode the source sequence and a decoder to generate the target text. Recently, a bunch of new approaches have emerged that apply decoder-only language models directly to the seq2seq task. Despite the significant advancements in applying language models to the seq2seq task, there is still a lack of thorough analysis on the effectiveness of the decoder-only language model architecture. This paper aims to address this gap by conducting a detailed comparison between the encoder-decoder architecture and the decoder-only language model framework through the analysis of a regularized encoder-decoder structure. This structure is designed to replicate all behaviors in the classical decoder-only language model but has an encoder and a decoder making it easier to be compared with the classical encoder-decoder structure. Based on the analysis, we unveil the attention degeneration problem in the language model, namely, as the generation step number grows, less and less attention is focused on the source sequence. To give a quantitative understanding of this problem, we conduct a theoretical sensitivity analysis of the attention output with respect to the source input. Grounded on our analysis, we propose a novel partial attention language model to solve the attention degeneration problem. Experimental results on machine translation, summarization, and data-to-text generation tasks support our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

We would like to suggest it is possible to go farther than this thesis and develop a computational-level theory which explains why this mechanistic difference between L2 and L1 speakers exists. For this purpose, we believe a noisy channel model (Shannon, 1948; Levy, 2008; Levy, Bicknell, Slattery \& Rayner, 2009; Gibson, Bergen \& Piantadosi, 2013) could be a good start. Under the reasonable assumption that L2 speakers have a less precise probabilistic representation of the syntax of their L2 language than L1 speakers do, the noisy channel model straightforwardly predicts that L2 comprehenders will depend more on world knowledge and discourse factors when interpreting and recalling utterances (cf. Gibson, Sandberg, Fedorenko, Bergen \& Kiran, 2015, for this assumption applied to language processing for persons with aphasia). Also, under the assumption that L2 speakers assume a higher error rate than L1 speakers do, the noisy channel model predicts that they will be more affected by alternative parses which are not directly compatible with the form of an utterance.},

  abstract = {I explore the hypothesis that the universal properties of human languages can be explained in terms of efficient communication given fixed human information processing constraints. I argue that under short-term memory constraints, optimal languages should exhibit information locality: words that depend on each other, both in their interpretation and in their statistical distribution, should be close to each other in linear order. The informationtheoretic approach to natural language motivates a study of quantitative syntax in Chapter 2, focusing on word order flexibility. In Chapter 3, I show comprehensive corpus evidence from over 40 languages that word order in grammar and usage is shaped by working memory constraints in the form of dependency locality: a pressure for syntactically linked words to be close. In Chapter 4, I develop a new formal model of language processing cost, called noisy-context surprisal, based on rational inference over noisy memory representations. This model unifies surprisal and memory effects and derives dependency locality effects as a subset of information locality effects. I show that the new processing model also resolves a long-standing paradox in the psycholinguistic literature, structural forgetting, where the effects of memory appear to be language-dependent. In the conclusion I discuss connections to probabilistic grammars, endocentricity, duality of patterning, incremental planning, and deep reinforcement learning.},

We present a computational model of word recognition which formalizes this perceptual process in Bayesian decision theory. We fit this model to explain scalp EEG signals recorded as subjects passively listened to a fictional story, revealing both the dynamics of the online auditory word recognition process and the neural correlates of the recognition and integration of words. The model reveals distinct neural processing of words depending on whether or not they can be quickly recognized. While all words trigger a neural response characteristic of probabilistic integration — voltage modulations predicted by a word's surprisal in context — these modulations are amplified for words which require more than roughly 150 ms of input to be recognized. We observe no difference in the latency of these neural responses according to words' recognition times. Our results support a two-part model of speech comprehension, combining an eager and rapid process of word recognition with a temporally independent process of word integration. However, we also developed alternative models of the scalp EEG signal not incorporating word recognition dynamics which showed similar performance improvements. We discuss potential future modeling steps which may help to separate these hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models, first published in 2007, is a comprehensive manual for the applied researcher who wants to perform data analysis using linear and nonlinear regression and multilevel models. The book introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the reader in how to fit these models using available software packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors' own applied research, with programming codes provided for each one. Topics covered include causal inference, including regression, poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided throughout.},

  abstract = {Preface This book is intended to have three roles and to serve three associated audiences: an introductory text on Bayesian inference starting from first principles, a graduate text on effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields, and a handbook of Bayesian methods in applied statistics for general users of and researchers in applied statistics. Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book},

  abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (“annealing”), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel “relaxation” algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

From an information theoretic point of view abstractions are desirable because they allow for very efficient information processing. In artificial systems abstractions are often implemented through computationally costly formations of groups or clusters. In this work we establish the relation between the free-energy framework for decision making and rate-distortion theory and demonstrate how the application of rate-distortion for decision-making leads to the emergence of abstractions. We argue that abstractions are induced due to a limit in information processing capacity.},

Achieving such flexibility in artificial systems is challenging, even with more and more computational power. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that abstraction and hierarchical information processing might in fact be the consequence of limitations in information-processing power. In particular, we study an information-theoretic framework of bounded rational decision-making that trades off utility maximization against information-processing costs. We apply the basic principle of this framework to perception-action systems with multiple information-processing nodes and derive bounded-optimal solutions. We show how the formation of abstractions and decision-making hierarchies depends on information-processing costs. We illustrate the theoretical ideas with example simulations and conclude by formalizing a mathematically unifying optimization principle that could potentially be extended to more complex systems.},

We chart advances over the past several decades that address challenges of perception and action under uncertainty through the lens of computation. Advances include the development of representations and inferential procedures for large-scale probabilistic inference and machinery for enabling reflection and decisions about tradeoffs in effort, precision, and timeliness of computations. These tools are deployed toward the goal of computational rationality: identifying decisions with highest expected utility, while taking into consideration the costs of computation in complex real-world problems in which most relevant calculations can only be approximated. We highlight key concepts with examples that show the potential for interchange between computer science, cognitive science, and neuroscience.},

As an alternative, it has been proposed that molecules within the cell body are the storage sites of memory, and that memories are formed through biochemical operations on these molecules. This paper proposes a synthesis of these two views, grounded in a computational model of memory. Synapses are conceived as storage sites for the parameters of an approximate posterior probability distribution over latent causes. Intracellular molecules are conceived as storage sites for the parameters of a generative model. The model stipulates how these two components work together as part of an integrated algorithm for learning and inference.},

  abstract = {This thesis gives a theory of sentence comprehension that attempts to explain a number of linguistic performance effects, including garden-path effects, preferred readings for ambiguous input and processing overload effects. It is hypothesized that the human parser heuristically determines its options based upon evaluation of possible representations with respect to lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties, each of which is associated with a weight. Processing overload effects are explained by the assumption of the existence of a maximum load corresponding to the limited capacity of short term memory: a structure becomes unacceptable at a particular parse state if the combination of the processing weights associated with its properties at that state is greater than the available capacity. Furthermore, it is assumed that the language processor is an automatic device that maintains only the best of the set of all compatible representations for an input string. This thesis assumes a formulation of representational evaluation within a parallel framework: one structure is preferred over another if the processing load associated with the first structure is markedly lower than the processing load associated with the second. Thus a garden path effect results if the unpreferred structure is necessary for a successful parse of the input. Four properties of linguistic representations are presented within this framework. The first two--the Properties of Thematic Reception and Transmission--derivable from the \$\textbackslash theta\$-Criterion from Government-Binding (GB) Theory (Chomsky (1981)); the third--the Property of Lexical Requirement--derivable from the Projection Principle of GB Theory; and the fourth--the Property of Recency Preference--prefers local attachments over more distant attachments (cf. Kimball (1973), Frazier (1979)). This thesis shows how these properties interact to give a partially unified theory of many performance effects.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new theory of the relationship between the sentence processing mechanism and the available computational resources. This theory – the Syntactic Prediction Locality Theory (SPLT) – has two components: an integration cost component and a component for the memory cost associated with keeping track of obligatory syntactic requirements. Memory cost is hypothesized to be quantified in terms of the number of syntactic categories that are necessary to complete the current input string as a grammatical sentence. Furthermore, in accordance with results from the working memory literature both memory cost and integration cost are hypothesized to be heavily influenced by locality (1) the longer a predicted category must be kept in memory before the prediction is satisfied, the greater is the cost for maintaining that prediction; and (2) the greater the distance between an incoming word and the most local head or dependent to which it attaches, the greater the integration cost. The SPLT is shown to explain a wide range of processing complexity phenomena not previously accounted for under a single theory, including (1) the lower complexity of subject-extracted relative clauses compared to object-extracted relative clauses, (2) numerous processing overload effects across languages, including the unacceptability of multiply center-embedded structures, (3) the lower complexity of cross-serial dependencies relative to center-embedded dependencies, (4) heaviness effects, such that sentences are easier to understand when larger phrases are placed later and (5) numerous ambiguity effects, such as those which have been argued to be evidence for the Active Filler Hypothesis.},

We introduce a method to obtain interpretable estimates of information value using neural text generators, and exploit their psychometric predictive power to investigate the dimensions of predictability that drive human comprehension behaviour. Information value is a stronger predictor of utterance acceptability in written and spoken dialogue than aggregates of token-level surprisal and it is complementary to surprisal for predicting eye-tracked reading times.},

Our framework provides a formal definition of anticipatory and responsive measures, and it equips experimenters with the tools to define new, more expressive measures beyond standard next-symbol entropy and surprisal. While extracting these standard quantities from language models is convenient, we demonstrate that using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate alternative responsive and anticipatory measures pays off empirically: New special cases of our generalized formula exhibit enhanced predictive power compared to surprisal for human cloze completion probability as well as ELAN, LAN, and N400 amplitudes, and greater complementarity with surprisal in predicting reading times.},

  abstract = {This study presents a new model of processing difficulty rooted in resource allocation theory, Incremental Alternative Sampling (IAS).  Differential difficulty for a linguistic unit is estimated with respect to a set of plausible alternatives. Compared to a surprisal-based model, it prescribes a more efficient use of a comprehender's predicted continuations of partial linguistic stimuli thanks to (i) an expressive representation function that captures different levels of linguistic processing and (ii) the bootstrapping of long-horizon prediction error. Our results show that IAS estimates of processing difficulty, computed with autoregressive language models via Monte Carlo estimation, have greater predictive power than surprisal extracted from the same language models for most neural and behavioural responses under analysis—including reading times, event-related brain potentials, cloze and predictability judgements.  Perhaps more importantly, IAS estimates provide insight into the nature of the predictive mechanisms that generate those responses during language comprehension.  Variability in neural and behavioural responses is well explained by different combinations of the representational and temporal resolution of prediction. Processing difficulty calculated at varying representational domains reflects known relations to lexical, constructional, and structural levels of linguistic processing, and forecast horizons are determined by a combination of experimental task setup and naturalness of the stimulus. Beyond enriching psycholinguistic models, IAS can also provide insights into the information processing mechanisms of computational language models.  Our analysis of next-word surprisal under the lenses of IAS reveals that, despite the metric's seemingly narrow focus on the upcoming word, language model surprisal implicitly captures anticipatory processing of multiple future lexical items.},

In this paper, we propose to augment importance sampling with systematic constraint-satisfaction search in order to overcome the rejection problem. The resulting SampleSearch scheme can be made unbiased by using a computationally expensive weighting scheme. To overcome this an approximation is proposed such that the resulting estimator is asymptotically unbiased. Our empirical results demonstrate the potential of our new scheme.},

  abstract = {Departing from traditional linguistic models, advances in deep learning have resulted in a new type of predictive (autoregressive) deep language models (DLMs). These models are trained to generate appropriate linguistic responses in a given context using a self-supervised prediction task. We provide empirical evidence that the human brain and autoregressive DLMs share two computational principles: 1) both are engaged in continuous prediction; 2) both represent words as a function of the previous context. Behaviorally, we demonstrate a match between humans and DLM’s next-word predictions given sufficient contextual windows during the processing of a real-life narrative. Neurally, we demonstrate that the brain, like autoregressive DLMs, constantly predicts upcoming words in natural speech, hundreds of milliseconds before they are perceived. Finally, we show that DLM’s contextual embeddings capture the neural representation of context-specific word meaning better than arbitrary or static semantic embeddings. Our findings suggest that autoregressive DLMs provide a novel and biologically feasible computational framework for studying the neural basis of language.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

There is accumulating evidence that neural models do not learn systematically. We examine the notion of systematicity from a linguistic perspective, defining a set of probing tasks and a set of metrics to measure systematic behaviour. We also identify ways in which network architectures can generalize non-systematically, and discuss why such forms of generalization may be unsatisfying. As a case study, we perform a series of experiments in the setting of natural language inference (NLI). We provide evidence that current state-of-the-art NLU systems do not generalize systematically, despite overall high performance.},

  abstract = {The concept of free energy has its origins in 19th century thermodynamics, but has recently found its way into the behavioral and neural sciences, where it has been promoted for its wide applicability and has even been suggested as a fundamental principle of understanding intelligent behavior and brain function. We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.},

These proposals combine a top-down parser with complexity metrics that relate parsing difficulty to memory usage. So far, though, there has been no large-scale exploration of the space of viable metrics. Building on this earlier work, we compare the ability of 1600 metrics to derive several processing effects observed with relative clauses, many of which have been proven difficult to unify. We show that among those 1600 candidates, a few metrics (and only a few) can provide a unified account of all these contrasts. This is a welcome result for two reasons: First, it provides a novel account of extensively studied psycholinguistic data. Second, it significantly limits the number of viable metrics that may be applied to other phenomena, thus reducing theoretical indeterminacy.},

  abstract = {Language models (LMs) have become ubiquitous in both NLP research and in commercial product offerings. As their commercial importance has surged, the most powerful models have become closed off, gated behind proprietary interfaces, with important details of their training data, architectures, and development undisclosed. Given the importance of these details in scientifically studying these models, including their biases and potential risks, we believe it is essential for the research community to have access to powerful, truly open LMs. To this end, this technical report details the first release of OLMo, a state-of-the-art, truly Open Language Model and its framework to build and study the science of language modeling. Unlike most prior efforts that have only released model weights and inference code, we release OLMo and the whole framework, including training data and training and evaluation code. We hope this release will empower and strengthen the open research community and inspire a new wave of innovation.},

As a complementary new resource for these tasks, we present the GitHub Typo Corpus, a large-scale, multilingual dataset of misspellings and grammatical errors along with their corrections harvested from GitHub, a large and popular platform for hosting and sharing git repositories. The dataset, which we have made publicly available, contains more than 350k edits and 65M characters in more than 15 languages, making it the largest dataset of misspellings to date. We also describe our process for filtering true typo edits based on learned classifiers on a small annotated subset, and demonstrate that typo edits can be identified with F1 0.9 using a very simple classifier with only three features. The detailed analyses of the dataset show that existing spelling correctors merely achieve an F-measure of approx. 0.5, suggesting that the dataset serves as a new, rich source of spelling errors that complement existing datasets.},

Recent research shows that these are predicted by adjective subjectivity, but the question remains open why this is the case. We first conduct a corpus study and not only replicate the subjectivity effect, but also find a previously undocumented effect of mutual information between adjectives and nouns. We then describe a rational model of adjective use in which listeners explicitly reason about judgments made by different speakers, formalizing the notion of subjectivity as agreement between speakers. We show that, once incremental processing is combined with memory limitations, our model predicts effects both of subjectivity and mutual information. We confirm the adequacy of our model by evaluating it on corpus data, finding that it correctly predicts ordering in unseen data with an accuracy of 96.2\%. This suggests that adjective ordering can be explained by general principles of human communication and language processing.},

  abstract = {The ordering of morphemes in a word displays well-documented regularities across languages. Previous work has explained these in terms of notions such as semantic scope, relevance, and productivity. Here, we test a recently formulated processing theory of the ordering of linguistic units, the efficient tradeoff hypothesis (Hahn et al., 2021). The claim of the theory is that morpheme ordering can partly be explained by the optimization of a tradeoff between memory and surprisal. This claim has received initial empirical support from two languages. In this work, we test this idea more extensively using data from four additional agglutinative languages with significant amounts of morphology, and by considering nouns in addition to verbs. We find that the efficient tradeoff hypothesis predicts ordering in most cases with high accuracy, and accounts for cross-linguistic regularities in noun and verb inflection. Our work adds to a growing body of work suggesting that many ordering properties of language arise from a pressure for efficient language processing.},

  abstract = {A major goal of psycholinguistic theory is to account for the cognitive constraints limiting the speed and ease of language comprehension and production. Wide-ranging evidence demonstrates a key role for linguistic expectations: A word’s predictability, as measured by the information-theoretic quantity of surprisal, is a major determinant of processing difficulty. But surprisal, under standard theories, fails to predict the difficulty profile of an important class of linguistic patterns: the nested hierarchical structures made possible by recursion in human language. These nested structures are better accounted for by psycholinguistic theories of constrained working memory capacity. However, progress on theory unifying expectation-based and memory-based accounts has been limited. Here we present a unified theory of a rational trade-off between precision of memory representations with ease of prediction, a scaled-up computational implementation using contemporary machine learning methods, and experimental evidence in support of the theory’s distinctive predictions. We show that the theory makes nuanced and distinctive predictions for difficulty patterns in nested recursive structures predicted by neither expectation-based nor memory-based theories alone. These predictions are confirmed 1) in two language comprehension experiments in English, and 2) in sentence completions in English, Spanish, and German. More generally, our framework offers computationally explicit theory and methods for understanding how memory constraints and prediction interact in human language comprehension and production.},

  abstract = {Scaling large language models (LLMs) leads to an emergent capacity to learn in-context from example demonstrations. Despite progress, theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. We argue that in-context learning relies on recombination of compositional operations found in natural language data. We derive an information-theoretic bound showing how in-context learning abilities arise from generic next-token prediction when the pretraining distribution has sufficient amounts of compositional structure, under linguistically motivated assumptions. A second bound provides a theoretical justification for the empirical success of prompting LLMs to output intermediate steps towards an answer. To validate theoretical predictions, we introduce a controlled setup for inducing in-context learning; unlike previous approaches, it accounts for the compositional nature of language. Trained transformers can perform in-context learning for a range of tasks, in a manner consistent with the theoretical results. Mirroring real-world LLMs in a miniature setup, in-context learning emerges when scaling parameters and data, and models perform better when prompted to output intermediate steps. Probing shows that in-context learning is supported by a representation of the input's compositional structure. Taken together, these results provide a step towards theoretical understanding of emergent behavior in large language models.},

Our model is implemented using contemporary neural network modeling techniques, and makes explicit and testable predictions about how the allocation of attention varies across different tasks. We test this in an eyetracking study comparing two versions of a reading comprehension task, finding that our model successfully accounts for reading behavior across the tasks.

  abstract = {Toward a probabilistic theory of human sentence processing, this dissertation proposes a definition of computational work done in the course of analyzing sentences generated by formal grammars. It applies the idea of entropy from information theory to the set of derivations compatible with an initial substring of a sentence. Given a probabilistic grammar, this permits the set of such compatible derivations to be viewed as a random variable, and the change in uncertainty about the outcomes to be calculated. This definition of computational work is examined as a cognitive model of human sentence processing difficulty. To apply the model, a variety of existing syntactic proposals for English sentences are cast as probabilistic Generalized Phrase Structure Grammars (Gazdar et al., 1985) and probabilistic Minimalist Grammars (Stabler, 1997). It is shown that the amount of predicted processing effort in relative clauses correlates with the Accessibility Hierarchy of relativized grammatical relations (Keenan and Comrie, 1977) on a Kaynian (1994) view of relative clause structure. Results from three new on-line sentence reading experiments suggest that while genitivity has the role suggested by the Accessibility Hierarchy, extraction from oblique does not. Evidence is also found for a direct object/indirect object processing asymmetry, which can be derived from the proposed cognitive model under the assumption of a lexicalized probabilistic grammar.},

  abstract = {Information-theoretical complexity metrics are auxiliary hypotheses that link theories of parsing and grammar to potentially observable measurements such as reading times and neural signals. This review article considers two such metrics, Surprisal and Entropy Reduction, which are respectively built upon the two most natural notions of ‘information value’ for an observed event (Blachman ). This review sketches their conceptual background and touches on their relationship to other theories in cognitive science. It characterizes them as ‘lenses’ through which theorists ‘see’ the information-processing consequences of linguistic grammars. While these metrics are not themselves parsing algorithms, the review identifies candidate mechanisms that have been proposed for both of them.},

Parsing with them using beam search yields a variety of incremental complexity metrics such as word surprisal and parser action count. When used as regressors against human electrophysiological responses to naturalistic text, they derive two amplitude effects: an early peak and a P600-like later peak. By contrast, a non-syntactic neural language model yields no reliable effects. Model comparisons attribute the early peak to syntactic composition within the RNNG. This pattern of results recommends the RNNG+beam search combination as a mechanistic model of the syntactic processing that occurs during normal human language comprehension.},

This paper re-evaluates a claim due to Goodkind and Bicknell (2018) that a language model's ability to model reading times is a linear function of its perplexity. By extending Goodkind and Bicknell's analysis to modern neural architectures, we show that the proposed relation does not always hold for Long Short-Term Memory networks, Transformers, and pre-trained models. We introduce an alternate measure of language modeling performance called predictability norm correlation based on Cloze probabilities measured from human subjects. Our new metric yields a more robust relationship between language model quality and psycholinguistic modeling performance that allows for comparison between models with different training configurations.},

  abstract = {Language comprehension requires successfully navigating linguistic variability. One hypothesis for how listeners manage variability is that they rapidly update their expectations of likely linguistic events in new contexts. This process, called adaptation, allows listeners to better predict the upcoming linguistic input. In previous work, Fine, Jaeger, Farmer, and Qian (PLoS ONE, 8, e77661, 2013) found evidence for syntactic adaptation. Subjects repeatedly encountered sentences in which a verb was temporarily ambiguous between main verb (MV) and reduced relative clause (RC) interpretations. They found that subjects who had higher levels of exposure to the unexpected RC interpretation of the sentences had an easier time reading the RC sentences but a more difficult time reading the MV sentences. They concluded that syntactic adaptation occurs rapidly in unexpected structures and also results in difficulty with processing the previously expected alternative structures. This article presents two experiments. Experiment 1 was designed as a follow-up to Fine et al.’s study and failed to find evidence of adaptation. A power analysis of Fine et al.’s raw data revealed that a similar study would need double the items and four times the subjects to reach 95\% power. In Experiment 2 we designed a close replication of Fine et al.’s experiment using these sample size guidelines. No evidence of rapid syntactic adaptation was found in this experiment. The failure to find evidence of adaptation in both experiments calls into question the robustness of the effect.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates agreement—in particular person agreement—in two configurations in Icelandic where there are two potential controllers of agreement and where at least in some cases agreement is with the lower of the two (a~“low nominative”). One case is the Dative-Nominative construction, where there is a dative subject and a lower nominative argument. The other is the Specificational Copular Clause (SCC) construction, where there are two nominative arguments. A much-discussed aspect of agreement in the former case is that agreement in number with the low nominative is generally possible, but agreement in person is at best highly restricted, leading in some cases to ineffability. This person effect has been claimed to be ameliorated by syncretism in the agreement paradigm, but there is limited data available substantiating this effect, which is however crucial to deciding between two recent types of account. This paper reports on a pair of experimental rating studies on the Dat-Nom and SCC configurations in Icelandic. We show that, taken together, the two sets of data provide evidence against the Person Licensing Condition and in favour of an account of the Dat-Nom construction in terms of morphological conflict arising from double agreement, although we show that the ameliorating effect of morphological syncretism, while real, is limited. Further, we show that there is no evidence of double agreement in the copular clauses investigated. We argue that full agreement with the low nominative here arises if the first nominal can move out of the domain of agreement entirely. The possibility of agreement with the initial nominal we suggest indicates that nominatives, unlike datives, cause the search of the agreement probe to terminate.},

Most studies of cognitive change are constrained, however, in their ability to detect subtle, but theoretically informative life-span changes, as they rely on either comparing broad age groups or sparse sampling across the age range. Here, we present convergent evidence from 48,537 online participants and a comprehensive analysis of normative data from standardized IQ and memory tests. Our results reveal considerable heterogeneity in when cognitive abilities peak: Some abilities peak and begin to decline around high school graduation; some abilities plateau in early adulthood, beginning to decline in subjects’ 30s; and still others do not peak until subjects reach their 40s or later. These findings motivate a nuanced theory of maturation and age-related decline, in which multiple, dissociable factors differentially affect different domains of cognition.},

It has been suggested that the brain uses prediction to guide the interpretation of incoming input. However, the role of prediction in language processing remains disputed, with disagreement about both the ubiquity and representational nature of predictions. Here, we address both issues by analyzing brain recordings of participants listening to audiobooks, and using a deep neural network (GPT-2) to precisely quantify contextual predictions. First, we establish that brain responses to words are modulated by ubiquitous predictions. Next, we disentangle model-based predictions into distinct dimensions, revealing dissociable neural signatures of predictions about syntactic category (parts of speech), phonemes, and semantics. Finally, we show that high-level (word) predictions inform low-level (phoneme) predictions, supporting hierarchical predictive processing. Together, these results underscore the ubiquity of prediction in language processing, showing that the brain spontaneously predicts upcoming language at multiple levels of abstraction.}

These methods have found numerous applications in statistics and related fields; for example, for inference in nonlinear non-Gaussian state space models, and in complex static models. Like many Monte Carlo sampling schemes, they rely on proposal distributions which crucially impact their performance. We introduce here a class of controlled sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, where the proposal distributions are determined by approximating the solution to an associated optimal control problem using an iterative scheme. This method builds upon a number of existing algorithms in econometrics, physics and statistics for inference in state space models, and generalizes these methods so as to accommodate complex static models. We provide a theoretical analysis concerning the fluctuation and stability of this methodology that also provides insight into the properties of related algorithms. We demonstrate significant gains over state-of-the-art methods at a fixed computational complexity on a variety of applications.},

  abstract = {The analytical methods of information theory are applied to the data obtained in certain choice-reaction-time experiments. Two types of experiment were performed: (a) a conventional choice-reaction experiment, with various numbers of alternatives up to ten, and with a negligible proportion of errors, and (b) a ten-choice experiment in which the subjects deliberately reduced their reaction time by allowing themselves various proportions of errors. The principal finding is that the rate of gain of information is, on the average, constant with respect to time, within the duration of one perceptual-motor act, and has a value of the order of five “bits” per second. The distribution of reaction times among the ten stimuli in the second experiment is shown to be related to the objective uncertainty as to which response will be given to each stimulus. The distribution of reaction times among the responses is also related to the same uncertainty. This is further evidence that information is intimately concerned with reaction time. Some possible conceptual models of the process are considered, but tests against the data are inconclusive.},

  abstract = {We propose a new model-based approach linking word learning to the age of acquisition (AoA) of words; a new computational tool for understanding the relationships among word learning processes, psychological attributes, and word AoAs as measures of vocabulary growth. The computational model developed describes the distinct statistical relationships between three theoretical factors underpinning word learning and AoA distributions. Simply put, this model formulates how different learning processes, characterized by change in learning rate over time and/or by the number of exposures required to acquire a word, likely result in different AoA distributions depending on word type. We tested the model in three respects. The first analysis showed that the proposed model accounts for empirical AoA distributions better than a standard alternative. The second analysis demonstrated that the estimated learning parameters well predicted the psychological attributes, such as frequency and imageability, of words. The third analysis illustrated that the developmental trend predicted by our estimated learning parameters was consistent with relevant findings in the developmental literature on word learning in children. We further discuss the theoretical implications of our model-based approach.},

Stochastic inference can easily handle data sets of this size and outperforms traditional variational inference, which can only handle a smaller subset.

  abstract = {Though there is a strong consensus that word length and frequency are the most important single-word features determining visual-orthographic access to the mental lexicon, there is less agreement as how to best capture syntactic and semantic factors. The traditional approach in cognitive reading research assumes that word predictability from sentence context is best captured by cloze completion probability (CCP) derived from human performance data. We review recent research suggesting that probabilistic language models provide deeper explanations for syntactic and semantic effects than CCP. Then we compare CCP with three probabilistic language models for predicting word viewing times in an English and a German eye tracking sample: (1) Symbolic n-gram models consolidate syntactic and semantic short-range relations by computing the probability of a word to occur, given two preceding words. (2) Topic models rely on subsymbolic representations to capture long-range semantic similarity by word co-occurrence counts in documents. (3) In recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the subsymbolic units are trained to predict the next word, given all preceding words in the sentences. To examine lexical retrieval, these models were used to predict single fixation durations and gaze durations to capture rapidly successful and standard lexical access, and total viewing time to capture late semantic integration. The linear item-level analyses showed greater correlations of all language models with all eye-movement measures than CCP. Then we examined non-linear relations between the different types of predictability and the reading times using generalized additive models. N-gram and RNN probabilities of the present word more consistently predicted reading performance compared with topic models or CCP. For the effects of last-word probability on current-word viewing times, we obtained the best results with n-gram models. Such count-based models seem to best capture short-range access that is still underway when the eyes move on to the subsequent word. The prediction-trained RNN models, in contrast, better predicted early preprocessing of the next word. In sum, our results demonstrate that the different language models account for differential cognitive processes during reading. We discuss these algorithmically concrete blueprints of lexical consolidation as theoretically deep explanations for human reading.},

  abstract = {Icelandic dative-nominative constructions exhibit a syntactic hierarchy effect known as the Person Restriction: only third person nominatives may control agreement. In these constructions, there is variation between speakers in the extent to which the verb agrees with the nominative for number. Sigurðsson \& Holmberg (2008) explain this variation as arising due to differences between varieties in the timing of subject raising, using a split phi-probe. This paper revises their approach, using the feature gluttony mechanism for Agree developed in Coon \& Keine (2020), and a split phi-probe in which person probing precedes number probing. Within this framework, the observed variation can be captured by allowing variability two independent parameters: the timing of EPP subject raising, and the visibility of a number feature on dative DPs. The proposed mechanism describes the variation, including predicting the observed optional agreement in certain cases that previous literature had struggled to account for, and makes additional predictions about the differences between varieties in cases of syncretism within the verbal paradigm. An investigation into these predictions should allow this already well-studied area of Icelandic grammar to continue to be a useful test-case for crosslinguistic assumptions about the mechanism of Agree, and the status of dative arguments.},

  abstract = {The threshold of intelligibility for a word in a wide-spectrum noise is shown to be a decreasing function of the frequency with which the word occurs in general linguistic usage (word frequency). The drop in threshold is about 4.5 db per logarithmic unit of word frequency. This rate is independent of the length of the word, although the thresholds for words of given frequency of occurrence are lower for long words.             The effect of restricting the listener's alternatives in an intelligibility test to a specified number of words is calculated from this relationship. These calculations come within 1 db of published experimental data. Theoretical functions relating intelligibility threshold to word length are also calculated from the word-frequency effect, on the assumption that listeners can discriminate the length of a word at levels too low for it to be identified. These functions are in general agreement with the experimental results.             Implications for intelligibility testing procedures are discussed.},

  abstract = {We investigate the extent to which individual attention heads in pretrained transformer language models, such as BERT and RoBERTa, implicitly capture syntactic dependency relations. We employ two methods---taking the maximum attention weight and computing the maximum spanning tree---to extract implicit dependency relations from the attention weights of each layer/head, and compare them to the ground-truth Universal Dependency (UD) trees. We show that, for some UD relation types, there exist heads that can recover the dependency type significantly better than baselines on parsed English text, suggesting that some self-attention heads act as a proxy for syntactic structure. We also analyze BERT fine-tuned on two datasets---the syntax-oriented CoLA and the semantics-oriented MNLI---to investigate whether fine-tuning affects the patterns of their self-attention, but we do not observe substantial differences in the overall dependency relations extracted using our methods. Our results suggest that these models have some specialist attention heads that track individual dependency types, but no generalist head that performs holistic parsing significantly better than a trivial baseline, and that analyzing attention weights directly may not reveal much of the syntactic knowledge that BERT-style models are known to learn.},

  abstract = {Scalar implicature (SI) arises when a speaker uses an expression (e.g., “some”) that is semantically compatible with a logically stronger alternative on the same scale (e.g., “all”), leading the listener to infer that they did not intend to convey the stronger meaning. Prior work has demonstrated that SI rates are highly variable across scales, raising the question of what factors determine the SI strength for a particular scale. Here, we test the hypothesis that SI rates depend on the listener's confidence in the underlying scale, which we operationalize as uncertainty over the distribution of possible alternatives conditioned on the context. We use a T5 model fine-tuned on a text infilling task to estimate this distribution. We find that scale uncertainty predicts human SI rates, measured as entropy over the sampled alternatives and over latent classes among alternatives in sentence embedding space. Furthermore, we do not find a significant effect of the surprisal of the strong scalemate. Our results suggest that pragmatic inferences depend on listeners' context-driven uncertainty over alternatives.},

While empirical studies have demonstrated that human SI rates are highly variable -- both within instances of a single scale, and across different scales -- there have been few proposals that quantitatively explain both cross- and within-scale variation. Furthermore, while it is generally assumed that SIs arise through reasoning about unspoken alternatives, it remains debated whether humans reason about alternatives as linguistic forms, or at the level of concepts. Here, we test a shared mechanism explaining SI rates within and across scales: context-driven expectations about the unspoken alternatives. Using neural language models to approximate human predictive distributions, we find that SI rates are captured by the expectedness of the strong scalemate as an alternative. Crucially, however, expectedness robustly predicts cross-scale variation only under a meaning-based view of alternatives. Our results suggest that pragmatic inferences arise from context-driven expectations over alternatives, and these expectations operate at the level of concepts.},

  abstract = {Language is one of the hallmarks of intelligence, demanding explanation in a theory of human cognition. However, language presents unique practical challenges for quantitative empirical research, making many linguistic theories difficult to test at naturalistic scales. Artificial neural network language models (LMs) provide a new tool for studying language with mathematical precision and control, as they exhibit remarkably sophisticated linguistic behaviors while being fully intervenable. While LMs differ from humans in many ways, the learning outcomes of these models can reveal the behaviors that may emerge through expressive statistical learning algorithms applied to linguistic input.     In this thesis, I demonstrate this approach through three case studies using LMs to investigate open questions in language acquisition and comprehension. First, I use LMs to perform controlled manipulations of language learning, and find that syntactic generalizations depend more on a learner's inductive bias than on training data size. Second, I use LMs to explain systematic variation in scalar inferences by approximating human listeners' expectations over unspoken alternative sentences (e.g., "The bill was supported overwhelmingly" implies that the bill was not supported unanimously). Finally, I show that LMs and humans exhibit similar behaviors on a set of non-literal comprehension tasks which are hypothesized to require social reasoning (e.g., inferring a speaker's intended meaning from ironic statements). These findings suggest that certain aspects of linguistic knowledge could emerge through domain-general prediction mechanisms, while other aspects may require specific inductive biases and conceptual structures.},

  abstract = {Recently CKY-based models show great potential in unsupervised grammar induction thanks to their human-like encoding paradigm, which runs recursively and hierarchically, but requires \$O(n\textasciicircum 3)\$ time-complexity. Recursive Transformer based on Differentiable Trees (R2D2) makes it possible to scale to large language model pre-training even with complex tree encoder by introducing a heuristic pruning method. However, the rule-based pruning approach suffers from local optimum and slow inference issues. In this paper, we fix those issues in a unified method. We propose to use a top-down parser as a model-based pruning method, which also enables parallel encoding during inference. Typically, our parser casts parsing as a split point scoring task, which first scores all split points for a given sentence, and then recursively splits a span into two by picking a split point with the highest score in the current span. The reverse order of the splits is considered as the order of pruning in R2D2 encoder. Beside the bi-directional language model loss, we also optimize the parser by minimizing the KL distance between tree probabilities from parser and R2D2. Our experiments show that our Fast-R2D2 improves performance significantly in grammar induction and achieves competitive results in downstream classification tasks.},

  abstract = {Previous research (Mirault, Snell, \& Grainger, 2018) has demonstrated that subjects sometimes incorrectly judge an ungrammatical sentence as grammatical when it is created by the transposition of two words in a grammatical sentence (e.g., The white was cat big). Here we present two eye-tracking experiments designed to assess the prevalence of this phenomenon in a more natural reading task, and to explore theoretical explanations. Readers failed to notice transpositions at about the same rate as in Mirault et al. (2018). Failure to notice the transposition was more common when both words were short, and when readers' eyes skipped, rather than directly fixated, one of the two words. The status of the transposed words as open- or closed-class did not have a reliable effect. The transposed words caused disruption in the eye movement record only on trials when participants ultimately judged the sentence to be ungrammatical, not when they judged the sentence to be grammatical. We argue that the results are not entirely consistent with the account offered by Mirault et al. (2018), which attributes failure to notice transpositions to parallel processing of adjacent words, or with a late, post-perceptual rational inference account (Gibson, Bergen, \& Piantadosi, 2013). We propose that word recognition is serial, but post-lexical integration of each word into its context may not be perfectly incremental.},

  abstract = {We propose a formal Bayesian definition of surprise to capture subjective aspects of sensory information. Surprise measures how data affects an observer, in terms of differences between posterior and prior beliefs about the world. Only data observations which substantially affect the observer’s beliefs yield surprise, irrespectively of how rare or informative in Shannon’s sense these observations are. We test the framework by quantifying the extent to which humans may orient attention and gaze towards surprising events or items while watching television. To this end, we implement a simple computational model where a low-level, sensory form of surprise is computed by simple simulated early visual neurons. Bayesian surprise is a strong attractor of human attention, with 72\% of all gaze shifts directed towards locations more surprising than the average, a figure rising to 84\% when focusing the analysis onto regions simultaneously selected by all observers. The proposed theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.},

  abstract = {Constraint satisfaction theories were prominent in the late 20th century and emphasized continuous, rich interaction between many sources of information in a linguistic signal unfolding over time. A major challenge was rigorously capturing these highly interactive comprehension processes and yielding explicit predictions, because the important constraints were numerous and changed in prominence from one context to the next. Connectionist models were conceptually well-suited to this, but researchers had insufficient computing power and lacked sufficiently large corpora to bring these models to bear. These limitations no longer hold, and large language models (LLMs) offer an opportunity to test constraint satisfaction ideas about human language comprehension. We consider how LLMs can be applied to study interactive processes with lexical ambiguity resolution as a test case. We argue that further study of LLMs can advance theories of constraint satisfaction, though gaps remain in our understanding of how people and LLMs combine linguistic information.},

  abstract = {We conducted two eye-tracking experiments investigating the processing of the Mandarin reflexive ziji in order to tease apart structurally constrained accounts from standard cue-based accounts of memory retrieval. In both experiments, we tested whether structurally inaccessible distractors that fulfill the animacy requirement of ziji influence processing times at the reflexive. In Experiment 1, we manipulated animacy of the antecedent and a structurally inaccessible distractor intervening between the antecedent and the reflexive. In conditions where the accessible antecedent mismatched the animacy cue, we found inhibitory interference whereas in antecedent-match conditions, no effect of the distractor was observed. In Experiment 2, we tested only antecedent-match configurations and manipulated locality of the reflexive-antecedent binding (Mandarin allows non-local binding). Participants were asked to hold three distractors (animate vs. inanimate nouns) in memory while reading the target sentence. We found slower reading times when animate distractors were held in memory (inhibitory interference). Moreover, we replicated the locality effect reported in previous studies. These results are incompatible with structure-based accounts. However, the cue-based ACT-R model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) cannot explain the observed pattern either. We therefore extend the original ACT-R model and show how this model not only explains the data presented in this article, but is also able to account for previously unexplained patterns in the literature on reflexive processing.},

We also provide a quantitative random-effects meta-analysis of eyetracking and self-paced reading studies. We show that the empirical evidence is only partly consistent with cue-based retrieval as implemented in the ACT-R-based model of sentence processing by Lewis and Vasishth (2005) (LV05) and that there are important differences between the reviewed dependency types. In non-agreement subject-verb dependencies, there is evidence for inhibitory interference in configurations where the correct dependent fully matches the retrieval cues. This is consistent with the LV05 cue-based retrieval account. By contrast, in subject-verb agreement as well as in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent dependencies, no evidence for inhibitory interference is found in configurations with a fully cue-matching subject/antecedent. In configurations with only a partially cue-matching subject or antecedent, the meta-analysis reveals facilitatory interference in subject-verb agreement and inhibitory interference in reflexives/reciprocals. The former is consistent with the LV05 account, but the latter is not. Moreover, the meta-analysis reveals that (i) interference type (proactive versus retroactive) leads to different effects in the reviewed dependency types and (ii) the prominence of the distractor strongly influences the interference effect. In sum, the meta-analysis suggests that the LV05 needs important modifications to account for the unexplained interference patterns and the differences between the dependency types. More generally, the meta-analysis provides a quantitative empirical basis for comparing the predictions of competing accounts of retrieval processes in sentence comprehension.},

Recent state-of-the-art incremental generative neural parsers are able to produce accurate parses and surprisal values but have unbounded stack memory, which may be used by the neural parser to maintain explicit in-order representations of all previously parsed words, inconsistent with results of human memory experiments. In contrast, humans seem to have a bounded working memory, demonstrated by inhibited performance on word recall in multi-clause sentences (Bransford and Franks, 1971), and on center-embedded sentences (Miller and Isard,1964). Bounded statistical parsers exist, but are less accurate than neural parsers in predict-ing reading times. This paper describes a neural incremental generative parser that is able to provide accurate surprisal estimates and can be constrained to use a bounded stack. Results show that the accuracy gains of neural parsers can be reliably extended to psycholinguistic modeling without risk of distortion due to un-bounded working memory.},

  abstract = {With large and growing datasets and complex models, there is an increasing need for scalable Bayesian inference. We describe two lines of work to address this need. In the first part, we develop new algorithms for inference in hierarchical Bayesian time series models based on the hidden Markov model (HMM), hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM), and their Bayesian nonparametric extensions. The HMM is ubiquitous in Bayesian time series models, and it and its Bayesian nonparametric extension, the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM), have been applied in many settings. HSMMs and HDP-HSMMs extend these dynamical models to provide state-specific duration modeling, but at the cost of increased computational complexity for inference, limiting their general applicability. A challenge with all such models is scaling inference to large datasets. We address these challenges in several ways. First, we develop classes of duration models for which HSMM message passing complexity scales only linearly in the observation sequence length. Second, we apply the stochastic variational inference (SVI) framework to develop scalable inference for the HMM, HSMM, and their nonparametric extensions. Third, we build on these ideas to define a new Bayesian nonparametric model that can capture dynamics at multiple timescales while still allowing efficient and scalable inference. In the second part of this thesis, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze a special case of a highly parallelizable sampling strategy we refer to as Hogwild Gibbs sampling. Thorough empirical work has shown that Hogwild Gibbs sampling works very well for inference in large latent Dirichlet allocation models (LDA), but there is little theory to understand when it may be effective in general. By studying Hogwild Gibbs applied to sampling from Gaussian distributions we develop analytical results as well as a deeper understanding of its behavior, including its convergence and correctness in some regimes.},

  abstract = {The problems of access—retrieving linguistic structure from some mental grammar —and disambiguation—choosing among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous linguistic input—are fundamental to language understanding. The literature abounds with psychological results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation, and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to combine models which account for these results to build a general, uniform model of access and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic levels. For example, psycholinguistic theories of lexical access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or coverage of psycholinguistic data. This article presents a single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions for access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path effect. I show that this motivated probabilistic treatment accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results, arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic knowledge and for the use of probabilistically-enriched grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.},

  abstract = {Incremental processing allows interactive systems to respond based on partial inputs, which is a desirable property e.g. in dialogue agents. The currently popular Transformer architecture inherently processes sequences as a whole, abstracting away the notion of time. Recent work attempts to apply Transformers incrementally via restart-incrementality by repeatedly feeding, to an unchanged model, increasingly longer input prefixes to produce partial outputs. However, this approach is computationally costly and does not scale efficiently for long sequences. In parallel, we witness efforts to make Transformers more efficient, e.g. the Linear Transformer (LT) with a recurrence mechanism. In this work, we examine the feasibility of LT for incremental NLU in English. Our results show that the recurrent LT model has better incremental performance and faster inference speed compared to the standard Transformer and LT with restart-incrementality, at the cost of part of the non-incremental (full sequence) quality. We show that the performance drop can be mitigated by training the model to wait for right context before committing to an output and that training with input prefixes is beneficial for delivering correct partial outputs.},

To explore this question in relation to a head-final language, a Japanese dative argument attachment ambiguity was examined in both a questionnaire study (Experiment 1) and a self-paced reading test (Experiment 2). The data suggested that the dative argument attachment ambiguity is resolved in the manner predicted by pre-head attachment accounts. The results were incompatible with most variants of the head-driven parsing model, and were not of the form currently predicted by constraint-satisfaction models. We end by discussing the general theoretical implications of the findings.},

Kawennón:nis is implemented with both web and mobile front-ends that communicate with an application programming interface that in turn communicates with a symbolic language model implemented as a finite state transducer. Eventually, it will serve as a foundation for several other applications for both Kanyen'kéha and other Iroquoian languages.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This paper investigates the influence of the relative size of speech communities on language use in multilingual regions and cities. Due to peoples’ everyday mobility inside a city, it is still unclear whether the size of a population matters for language use on a sub-city scale. By testing the correlation between the size of a population and language use on various spatial scales, this study will contribute to a better understanding of the extent to which sociodemographic factors influence language use. The present study investigates two particular phenomena that are common to multilingual speakers, namely language mixing or Code-Switching and using multiple languages without mixing. Demographic information from a Canadian census will make predictions about the intensity of Code-Switching and language use by multilinguals in cities of Quebec and neighborhoods of Montreal. Geolocated tweets will be used to identify where these linguistic phenomena occur the most and the least. My results show that the intensity of Code-Switching and the use of English by bilinguals is influenced by the size of anglophone and francophone populations on various spatial scales such as the city level, land use level (city center vs. periphery of Montreal), and large urban zones on the sub-city level, namely the western and eastern urban zones of Montreal. However, the correlation between population figures and language use is difficult to measure and evaluate on a much smaller sub-urban scale such as the city block scale due to factors such as population figures missing from the census and people’s mobility. A qualitative evaluation of language use on a small spatial scale seems to suggest that other social influences such as the location context or topic of discussion are much more important predictors for language use than population figures. Methods will be suggested for testing this hypothesis in future research. I conclude that geographic space can provide us information about the relation between language use in multilingual cities and sociodemographic factors such as a speech community’s size and that social media is a valuable alternative data source for sociolinguistic research that offers new insights into the mechanisms of language use such as Code-Switching.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Grammatical illusions provide a challenge for linguists to understand why we do not immediately reject illusions like we do for most ungrammatical sentences. One type of illusion that has stirred several ongoing debates is the Escher Sentence. This dissertation focuses on the source of the illusory effect, or the reason why people fail to consistently reject these sentences. This dissertation explores the properties of Escher Sentences, the reason why they are illusory in nature, and what this contributes to our understanding of the parser. Six Experiments were designed to test the acceptability judgments, interpretations, and neurophysiological responses to these sentences. I conclude that Escher Sentences are recognized by the parser as ungrammatical, but because of the structure of these sentences, the parser is tricked into using a coercive operation to force Escher Sentences to have an acceptable interpretation. Escher Sentences gives us potential insight into the constraints of the parser in processing language while at the same time highlighting the parser’s strategies in resolving computations that are ungrammatical.},

  abstract = {We show that constituency parsing benefits from unsupervised pre-training across a variety of languages and a range of pre-training conditions. We first compare the benefits of no pre-training, fastText, ELMo, and BERT for English and find that BERT outperforms ELMo, in large part due to increased model capacity, whereas ELMo in turn outperforms the non-contextual fastText embeddings. We also find that pre-training is beneficial across all 11 languages tested; however, large model sizes (more than 100 million parameters) make it computationally expensive to train separate models for each language. To address this shortcoming, we show that joint multilingual pre-training and fine-tuning allows sharing all but a small number of parameters between ten languages in the final model. The 10x reduction in model size compared to fine-tuning one model per language causes only a 3.2\% relative error increase in aggregate. We further explore the idea of joint fine-tuning and show that it gives low-resource languages a way to benefit from the larger datasets of other languages. Finally, we demonstrate new state-of-the-art results for 11 languages, including English (95.8 F1) and Chinese (91.8 F1).},

Our goal is to induce a syntactic representation that commits to syntactic choices only as they are incrementally revealed by the input, in contrast with standard representations that must make output choices such as attachments speculatively and later throw out conflicting analyses. Our learned representations achieve 93.72 F1 on the Penn Treebank with as few as 5 bits per word, and at 8 bits per word they achieve 94.97 F1, which is comparable with other state of the art parsing models when using the same pre-trained embeddings. We also provide an analysis of the representations learned by our system, investigating properties such as the interpretable syntactic features captured by the system and mechanisms for deferred resolution of syntactic ambiguities.},

We present a novel method for characterizing the information structure of sentences across a diverse set of languages. While the structure of English is broadly consistent with the shape predicted by optimal coding, many languages are not consistent with this prediction. We proceed to show that the characteristic information curves of languages are partly related to a variety of typological features from phonology to word order. These results present an important step in the direction of exploring upper bounds for the extent to which linguistic codes can be optimal for communication.},

Two different theoretical derivations lead to distributions which are quite different from the probability distributions that are usually used for backing-off.

Their method of constructing the complete data sets is closely related to the Gibbs sampler. Both required iterations, and, similar to the EM algorithm, convergence can be slow. We introduce in this article an alternative procedure that involves imputing the missing data sequentially and computing appropriate importance sampling weights. In many applications this new procedure works very well without the need for iterations. Sensitivity analysis, influence analysis, and updating with new data can be performed cheaply. Bayesian prediction and model selection can also be incorporated. Examples taken from a wide range of applications are used for illustration.},

Following the integration cost hypothesis (Gibson, 1998), processing verbs should be the harder, the more complement integrations have to take place. In contrast, probabilistic prediction-based models, like Simple Recurrent Networks (SRNs, Elman, 1990), might anticipate verbs the better, the more dependents have been encountered beforehand. We trained SRNs with a subset of the German language to establish basic dependency relationships between verbs and their arguments in both verb-second and verb-final constructions. The test results established a clear anticipation hypothesis: the more arguments precede the verb, the lower the prediction error and hence, predicted reading times. The data from an eye-tracking experiment confirm the anticipation hypothesis: Clause final verbs are read faster when an additional Dative, instead of a noun-modifying Genitive, is read beforehand. Adverbial PP-adjuncts, in contrast to Noun-modifying PPs, however, did not affect reading times. In general, the results support a restricted anticipation hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Language models (LMs) are often expected to generate strings in some formal language; for example, structured data, API calls, or code snippets. Although LMs can be tuned to improve their adherence to formal syntax, this does not *guarantee* conformance, especially with smaller LMs suitable for large-scale deployment. In addition, tuning requires significant resources, making it impractical for uncommon or task-specific formats. To prevent downstream parsing errors we would ideally *constrain* the LM to only produce valid output, but this is severely complicated by tokenization, which is typically both ambiguous and misaligned with the formal grammar. We solve these issues through the application of automata theory, deriving an efficient closed-form solution for the *regular languages*, a broad class of formal languages with many practical applications, including API calls or schema-guided JSON and YAML. We also discuss pragmatic extensions for coping with the issue of high branching factor, and extend our techniques to *deterministic context-free languages*, which similarly admit an efficient closed-form solution. Previous work on this topic (Willard and Louf, 2023) layers bespoke solutions onto automata, leading to problems with speed, correctness, and extensibility. Instead, we reformulate the entire task in terms of automata so we can leverage well-studied and well-optimized algorithms. Our system compiles constraints \textasciitilde 7,000x faster, is provably correct, and can be extended in a modular fashion.},

We show how to implicitly apply this ’Gumbel-Top-𝑘kk’ trick on a factorized distribution over sequences, allowing to draw exact samples without replacement using a Stochastic Beam Search. Even for exponentially large domains, the number of model evaluations grows only linear in 𝑘kk and the maximum sampled sequence length. The algorithm creates a theoretical connection between sampling and (deterministic) beam search and can be used as a principled intermediate alternative. In a translation task, the proposed method compares favourably against alternatives to obtain diverse yet good quality translations. We show that sequences sampled without replacement can be used to construct low-variance estimators for expected sentence-level BLEU score and model entropy.},

  abstract = {Event segmentation theory posits that people segment continuous experience into discrete events and that event boundaries occur when there are large transient increases in prediction error. Here, we set out to test this theory in the context of story listening, by using a deep learning language model (GPT-2) to compute the predicted probability distribution of the next word, at each point in the story. For three stories, we used the probability distributions generated by GPT-2 to compute the time series of prediction error. We also asked participants to listen to these stories while marking event boundaries. We used regression models to relate the GPT-2 measures to the human segmentation data. We found that event boundaries are associated with transient increases in Bayesian surprise but not with a simpler measure of prediction error (surprisal) that tracks, for each word in the story, how strongly that word was predicted at the previous time point. These results support the hypothesis that prediction error serves as a control mechanism governing event segmentation and point to important differences between operational definitions of prediction error.},

It has been empirically shown that VB is less likely to cause overfitting. Moreover, the free energy of VB has been successfully used in model selection. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization of PCFG induction algorithms proposed before. In the experiments, we empirically show that induced grammars achieve better parsing results than those of other PCFG induction algorithms. Based on the better parsing results, we give examples of recursive grammatical structures found by the proposed algorithm.},

The e.r.ps triggered by verbal stimuli have been related to several different aspects of language processing. For example, the N400 component, peaking around 400 ms post-stimulus, appears to be a sensitive indicator of the semantic relationship between a word and the context in which it occurs. Words that complete sentences in a nonsensical fashion elicit much larger N400 waves than do semantically appropriate words or non-semantic irregularities in a text. In the present study, e.r.ps were recorded in response to words that completed meaningful sentences. The amplitude of the N400 component of the e.r.p. was found to be an inverse function of the subject's expectancy for the terminal word as measured by its 'Cloze probability'. In addition, unexpected words that were semantically related to highly expected words elicited lower N400 amplitudes. These findings suggest N400 may reflect processes of semantic priming or activation.},

  abstract = {The comprehension of subject-verb agreement shows “attraction effects,” which reveal that number computations can be derailed by nouns that are grammatically unlicensed to control agreement with a verb. However, previous results are mixed regarding whether attraction affects the processing of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences alike. In a large-sample eye-tracking replication of Lago et al. (2015), we support this “grammaticality asymmetry” by showing that the reading profiles associated with attraction depend on sentence grammaticality. In ungrammatical sentences, attraction affected both fixation durations and regressive eye-movements at the critical disagreeing verb. Meanwhile, both grammatical and ungrammatical sentences showed effects of the attractor noun number prior to the verb, in the first- and second-pass reading of the subject phrase. This contrast suggests that attraction effects in comprehension have at least two different sources: the first reflects verb-triggered processes that operate mainly in ungrammatical sentences. The second source reflects difficulties in the encoding of the subject phrase, which disturb comprehension in both grammatical and ungrammatical sentences.},

First, we introduce a theoretical framework that formalizes the idea of policy compression, or the reduction in cognitive cost of representing action policies by making them simpler. We then describe how a wide range of behavioral phenomena, including stochasticity, perseveration, response time, state and action chunking, and navigation are brought together under this framework. Finally, we discuss how our model can be used to probe the neural underpinnings of policy compression and their dysfunction in psychiatric illness.},

  abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

It is shown that SCFGs can model this low-level VQ data accurately and that a regular grammar based pre-training algorithm is effective both for reducing training time and obtaining robust solutions. Second, an SCFG is inferred from a transcription of the speech used to train a phoneme-based recognizer in an attempt to model phonotactic constraints. When used as a language model, this SCFG gives improved performance over a comparable regular grammar or bigram.},

  abstract = {The question of whether humans represent grammatical knowledge as a binary condition on membership in a set of well-formed sentences, or as a probabilistic property has been the subject of debate among linguists, psychologists, and cognitive scientists for many decades. Acceptability judgments present a serious problem for both classical binary and probabilistic theories of grammaticality. These judgements are gradient in nature, and so cannot be directly accommodated in a binary formal grammar. However, it is also not possible to simply reduce acceptability to probability. The acceptability of a sentence is not the same as the likelihood of its occurrence, which is, in part, determined by factors like sentence length and lexical frequency. In this paper, we present the results of a set of large-scale experiments using crowd-sourced acceptability judgments that demonstrate gradience to be a pervasive feature in acceptability judgments. We then show how one can predict acceptability judgments on the basis of probability by augmenting probabilistic language models with an acceptability measure. This is a function that normalizes probability values to eliminate the confounding factors of length and lexical frequency. We describe a sequence of modeling experiments with unsupervised language models drawn from state-of-the-art machine learning methods in natural language processing. Several of these models achieve very encouraging levels of accuracy in the acceptability prediction task, as measured by the correlation between the acceptability measure scores and mean human acceptability values. We consider the relevance of these results to the debate on the nature of grammatical competence, and we argue that they support the view that linguistic knowledge can be intrinsically probabilistic.},

  abstract = {Transformer-based language models (LMs) continue to achieve state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks, including tasks designed to mimic human-inspired “commonsense” competencies. To better understand the degree to which LMs can be said to have certain linguistic reasoning skills, researchers are beginning to adapt the tools and concepts from psychometrics. But to what extent can benefits flow in the other direction? In other words, can LMs be of use in predicting the psychometric properties of test items, when those items are given to human participants? If so, the benefit for psychometric practitioners is enormous, as it can reduce the need for multiple rounds of empirical testing. We gather responses from numerous human participants and LMs (transformer- and non-transformer-based) on a broad diagnostic test of linguistic competencies. We then use the human responses to calculate standard psychometric properties of the items in the diagnostic test, using the human responses and the LM responses separately. We then determine how well these two sets of predictions correlate. We find that transformer-based LMs predict the human psychometric data consistently well across most categories, suggesting that they can be used to gather human-like psychometric data without the need for extensive human trials.},

  abstract = {Across languages, word frequency and rank follow a power law relation, forming a distribution known as the Zipfian distribution. There is growing experimental evidence that this well-studied phenomenon may be beneficial for language learning. However, most investigations of word distributions in natural language have focused on adult-to-adult speech: Zipf’s law has not been thoroughly evaluated in child-directed speech (CDS) across languages. If Zipfian distributions facilitate learning, they should also be found in CDS. At the same time, several unique properties of CDS may result in a less skewed distribution. Here, we examine the frequency distribution of words in CDS in three studies. We first show that CDS is Zipfian across 15 languages from seven language families. We then show that CDS is Zipfian from early on (six-months) and across development for five languages with sufficient longitudinal data. Finally, we show that the distribution holds across different parts of speech: Nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions follow a Zipfian distribution. Together, the results show that the input children hear is skewed in a particular way from early on, providing necessary (but not sufficient) support for the postulated learning advantage of such skew. They highlight the need to study skewed learning environments experimentally.}

  abstract = {Humans are intuitively good at providing judgments about what forms part of their native language and what does not. Although such judgments are robust, consistent, and reliable, human cognition is demonstrably fallible to illusions of various types. Language is no exception. In the linguistic domain, several types of sentences have been shown to trick the parser into giving them a high acceptability judgment despite their ill-formedness. One example is the so-called comparative illusion (‘More people have been to Tromsø than I have’). To this day, comparative illusions have been tested mainly with monolingual, neurotypical speakers of English. The present research aims to broaden our understanding of this phenomenon by putting it to test in two populations that differ in one crucial factor: the number of languages they speak. A timed acceptability judgment task was administered to monolingual speakers of Standard Greek and bi(dia)lectal speakers of Standard and Cypriot Greek. The results are not fully in line with any of the semantic re-analyses proposed for the illusion so far, hence a new proposal is offered about what interpretation induces the illusion, appreciating the influence of both grammatical processing and cognitive heuristics. Second, the results reveal an effect of developmental trajectory. This effect may be linked to an enhanced ability to spot the illusion in bi(dia)lectals, but several factors can be identified as possible culprits behind this result. After discussing each of them, it is argued that having two grammars may facilitate the setting of a higher processing threshold, something that would entail decreased fallibility to grammatical illusions.},

  abstract = {Throughout the last two decades, Bayesian statistical methods have proliferated throughout ecology and evolution. Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a ‘consumer's guide’ to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient ‘reference’ prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new ‘default’ prior for any Bayesian model.},

  abstract = {This thesis takes up the problem of syntactic comprehension, or parsing—how an agent (human or machine) with knowledge of a specific language goes about inferring the hierarchical structural relationships underlying a surface string in the language. I take the position that probabilistic models of combining evidential information are cognitively plausible and practically useful for syntactic comprehension. In particular, the thesis applies probabilistic methods in investigating the relationship between word order and psycholinguistic models of comprehension; and in the practical problems of accuracy and efficiency in parsing sentences with syntactic discontinuity. On the psychological side, the thesis proposes a theory of expectation-based processing difficulty as a consequence of probabilistic syntactic disambiguation: the ease of processing a word during comprehension is determined primarily by the degree to which that word is expected. I identify a class of syntactic phenomena, associated primarily with verb-final clause order, where the predictions of expectation-based processing diverge most sharply from more established locality-based theories of processing difficulty. Using existing probabilistic parsing algorithms and syntactically annotated data sources, I show that the expectation-based theory matches a range of established experimental psycholinguistic results better than locality-based theories. The comparison of probabilistic- and locality-driven processing theories is a crucial area of psycholinguistic research due to its implications for the relationship between linguistic production and comprehension, and more generally for theories of modularity in cognitive science. The thesis also takes up the problem of probabilistic models for discontinuous constituency, when phrases do not consist of continuous substrings of a sentence. Discontinuity poses a computational challenge in parsing, because it expands the set of possible substructures in a sentence beyond the bound, quadratic in sentence length, on the set of possible continuous constituents. For discontinuous constituency, I investigate the problem of accuracy employing discriminative classifiers organized on principles of syntactic theory and used to introduce discontinuous relationships into otherwise strictly context-free phrase structure trees; and the problem of efficiency in joint inference over both continuous and discontinuous structures, using probabilistic instantiations of mildly context-sensitive grammatical formalisms and factorizing grammatical generalizations into probabilistic components of dominance and linear order.},

The paper proposes a simple information-theoretic characterization of processing difficulty as the work incurred by resource reallocation during parallel, incremental, probabilistic disambiguation in sentence comprehension, and demonstrates its equivalence to the theory of Hale [Hale, J. (2001). A probabilistic Earley parser as a psycholinguistic model. In Proceedings of NAACL (Vol. 2, pp. 159–166)], in which the difficulty of a word is proportional to its surprisal (its negative log-probability) in the context within which it appears. This proposal subsumes and clarifies findings that high-constraint contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and connects these findings to well-known models of parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition, the theory leads to a number of specific predictions about the role of expectation in syntactic comprehension, including the reversal of locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically constrained contexts, and conditions under which increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper examines a range of established results bearing on these predictions, and shows that they are largely consistent with the surprisal theory.},

Yet perception is inevitably uncertain, and a system making optimal use of available information might retain this uncertainty and interactively recruit grammatical analysis and subsequent perceptual input to help resolve it. To test for the possibility of such an interaction, we tracked readers' eye movements as they read sentences constructed to vary in (i) whether an early word had near neighbors of a different grammatical category, and (ii) how strongly another word further downstream cohered grammatically with these potential near neighbors. Eye movements indicated that readers maintain uncertain beliefs about previously read word identities, revise these beliefs on the basis of relative grammatical consistency with subsequent input, and use these changing beliefs to guide saccadic behavior in ways consistent with principles of rational probabilistic inference.},

  abstract = {In most languages, most of the syntactic dependency relations found in any given sentence are projective: the word–word dependencies in the sentence do not cross each other. Some syntactic dependency relations, however, are non-projective: some of their word–word dependencies cross each other. Non-projective dependencies are both rarer and more computationally complex than projective dependencies; hence, it is of natural interest to investigate whether there are any processing costs specific to non-projective dependencies, and whether factors known to influence processing of projective dependencies also affect non-projective dependency processing. We report three self-paced reading studies, together with corpus and sentence completion studies, investigating the comprehension difficulty associated with the non-projective dependencies created by the extraposition of relative clauses in English. We find that extraposition over either verbs or prepositional phrases creates comprehension difficulty, and that this difficulty is consistent with probabilistic syntactic expectations estimated from corpora. Furthermore, we find that manipulating the expectation that a given noun will have a postmodifying relative clause can modulate and even neutralize the difficulty associated with extraposition. Our experiments rule out accounts based purely on derivational complexity and/or dependency locality in terms of linear positioning. Our results demonstrate that comprehenders maintain probabilistic syntactic expectations that persist beyond projective-dependency structures, and suggest that it may be possible to explain observed patterns of comprehension difficulty associated with extraposition entirely through probabilistic expectations.},

Memory-based and expectation-based theories make opposite predictions regarding fine-grained time course of processing difficulty in syntactically constrained contexts, and each class of theory receives support from results on some constructions in some languages. Here we report four self-paced reading experiments on the online comprehension of Russian relative clauses together with related corpus studies, taking advantage of Russian’s flexible word order to disentangle predictions of competing theories. We find support for key predictions of memory-based theories in reading times at RC verbs, and for key predictions of expectation-based theories in processing difficulty at RC-initial accusative noun phrase (NP) objects, which corpus data suggest should be highly unexpected. These results suggest that a complete theory of syntactic complexity must integrate insights from both expectation-based and memory-based theories.},

  abstract = {One hallmark of human reasoning is that we can bring to bear a diverse web of common-sense knowledge in any situation. The vastness of our knowledge poses a challenge for the practical implementation of reasoning systems as well as for our cognitive theories – how do people represent their common-sense knowledge? On the one hand, our best models of sophisticated reasoning are top-down, making use primarily of symbolically-encoded knowledge. On the other, much of our understanding of the statistical properties of our environment may arise in a bottom-up fashion, for example through asso- ciationist learning mechanisms. Indeed, recent advances in AI have enabled the development of billion-parameter language models that can scour for patterns in gigabytes of text from the web, picking up a surprising amount of common-sense knowledge along the way—but they fail to learn the structure of coherent reasoning. We propose combining these approaches, by embedding language-model-backed primitives into a state- of-the-art probabilistic programming language (PPL). On two open-ended reasoning tasks, we show that our PPL models with neural knowledge components characterize the distribution of human responses more accurately than the neural language models alone, raising interesting questions about how people might use language as an interface to common-sense knowledge, and suggesting that building probabilistic models with neural language-model components may be a promising approach for more human-like AI.},

  abstract = {A key design constraint when implementing Monte Carlo and variational inference algorithms is that it must be possible to cheaply and exactly evaluate the marginal densities of proposal distributions and variational families. This takes many interesting proposals off the table, such as those based on involved simulations or stochastic optimization. This paper broadens the design space, by presenting a framework for applying Monte Carlo and variational inference algorithms when proposal densities cannot be exactly evaluated. Our framework, recursive auxiliary-variable inference (RAVI), instead approximates the necessary densities using meta-inference: an additional layer of Monte Carlo or variational inference, that targets the proposal, rather than the model. RAVI generalizes and unifies several existing methods for inference with expressive approximating families, which we show correspond to specific choices of meta-inference algorithm, and provides new theory for analyzing their bias and variance. We illustrate RAVI’s design framework and theorems by using them to analyze and improve upon Salimans et al.’s Markov Chain Variational Inference, and to design a novel sampler for Dirichlet process mixtures, achieving state-of-the-art results on a standard benchmark dataset from astronomy and on a challenging datacleaning task with Medicare hospital data.},

We propose a new inference-time approach to enforcing syntactic and semantic constraints on the outputs of LLMs, called sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) steering. The key idea is to specify language generation tasks as posterior inference problems in a class of discrete probabilistic sequence models, and replace standard decoding with sequential Monte Carlo inference. For a computational cost similar to that of beam search, SMC can steer LLMs to solve diverse tasks, including infilling, generation under syntactic constraints, and prompt intersection. To facilitate experimentation with SMC steering, we present a probabilistic programming library, LLaMPPL (https://github.com/probcomp/LLaMPPL), for concisely specifying new generation tasks as language model probabilistic programs, and automating steering of LLaMA-family Transformers.},

In SMCP3, proposal kernels can be general probabilistic programs, which differ from traditional proposal densities in that they may sample many auxiliary variables, and may apply deterministic post-processing to calculate a proposed update. We have implemented our framework in the Gen probabilistic programming platform: given probabilistic programs that specify target distributions, forward kernels, and reverse kernels, our implementation fully automates the sound computation of incremental importance weights. To illustrate the effectiveness of SMCP3 algorithms, we apply our framework in two domains. First, we use it for online state-estimation, using proposal programs based on Langevin ascent to reduce the bias in log marginal likelihood estimates relative to resample-move SMC with Langevin rejuvenation. Second, we demonstrate an SMCP3 algorithm that yields more robust online clustering in Dirichlet process mixture models than strong SMC baselines.},

The theory is derived from the application of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought–Rational (ACT–R) architecture, and our process model is realized in ACT–R. We present the results of 6 sets of simulations: 5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model' complete reliance on discriminating retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT–R defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

  abstract = {Transformer-based language models have recently achieved remarkable results in many natural language tasks. However, performance on leaderboards is generally achieved by leveraging massive amounts of training data, and rarely by encoding explicit linguistic knowledge into neural models. This has led many to question the relevance of linguistics for modern natural language processing. In this dissertation, I present several case studies to illustrate how theoretical linguistics and neural language models are still relevant to each other. First, language models are useful to linguists by providing an objective tool to measure semantic distance, which is difficult to do using traditional methods. On the other hand, linguistic theory contributes to language modelling research by providing frameworks and sources of data to probe our language models for specific aspects of language understanding. This thesis contributes three studies that explore different aspects of the syntax-semantics interface in language models. In the first part of my thesis, I apply language models to the problem of word class flexibility. Using mBERT as a source of semantic distance measurements, I present evidence in favour of analyzing word class flexibility as a directional process. In the second part of my thesis, I propose a method to measure surprisal at intermediate layers of language models. My experiments show that sentences containing morphosyntactic anomalies trigger surprisals earlier in language models than semantic and commonsense anomalies. Finally, in the third part of my thesis, I adapt several psycholinguistic studies to show that language models contain knowledge of argument structure constructions. In summary, my thesis develops new connections between natural language processing, linguistic theory, and psycholinguistics to provide fresh perspectives for the interpretation of language models.},

  abstract = {A large body of work in psycholinguistics has focused on the idea that online language comprehension can be shallow or `good enough': given constraints on time or available computation, comprehenders may form interpretations of their input that are plausible but inaccurate. However, this idea has not yet been linked with formal theories of computation under resource constraints. Here we use information theory to formulate a model of language comprehension as an optimal trade-off between accuracy and processing depth, formalized as bits of information extracted from the input, which increases with processing time. The model provides a measure of processing effort as the change in processing depth, which we link to EEG signals and reading times. We validate our theory against a large-scale dataset of garden path sentence reading times, and EEG experiments featuring N400, P600 and biphasic ERP effects. By quantifying the timecourse of language processing as it proceeds from shallow to deep, our model provides a unified framework to explain behavioral and neural signatures of language comprehension.},

  abstract = {Controlling the behavior of language models (LMs) without re-training is a major open problem in natural language generation. While recent works have demonstrated successes on controlling simple sentence attributes (e.g., sentiment), there has been little progress on complex, fine-grained controls (e.g., syntactic structure). To address this challenge, we develop a new non-autoregressive language model based on continuous diffusions that we call Diffusion-LM. Building upon the recent successes of diffusion models in continuous domains, Diffusion-LM iteratively denoises a sequence of Gaussian vectors into word vectors, yielding a sequence of intermediate latent variables. The continuous, hierarchical nature of these intermediate variables enables a simple gradient-based algorithm to perform complex, controllable generation tasks. We demonstrate successful control of Diffusion-LM for six challenging fine-grained control tasks, significantly outperforming prior work.},

This non-linear probabilistic model enables us to go beyond the limited modeling capacity of linear factor models which still largely dominate collaborative filtering research.We introduce a generative model with multinomial likelihood and use Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. Despite widespread use in language modeling and economics, the multinomial likelihood receives less attention in the recommender systems literature. We introduce a different regularization parameter for the learning objective, which proves to be crucial for achieving competitive performance. Remarkably, there is an efficient way to tune the parameter using annealing. The resulting model and learning algorithm has information-theoretic connections to maximum entropy discrimination and the information bottleneck principle. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, including two recently-proposed neural network approaches, on several real-world datasets. We also provide extended experiments comparing the multinomial likelihood with other commonly used likelihood functions in the latent factor collaborative filtering literature and show favorable results. Finally, we identify the pros and cons of employing a principled Bayesian inference approach and characterize settings where it provides the most significant improvements.},

  abstract = {Modeling human cognition is challenging because there are infinitely many mechanisms that can generate any given observation. Some researchers address this by constraining the hypothesis space through assumptions about what the human mind can and cannot do, while others constrain it through principles of rationality and adaptation. Recent work in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics has begun to integrate both approaches by augmenting rational models with cognitive constraints, incorporating rational principles into cognitive architectures, and applying optimality principles to understanding neural representations. We identify the rational use of limited resources as a unifying principle underlying these diverse approaches, expressing it in a new cognitive modeling paradigm called resource-rational analysis. The integration of rational principles with realistic cognitive constraints makes resource-rational analysis a promising framework for reverse-engineering cognitive mechanisms and representations. It has already shed new light on the debate about human rationality and can be leveraged to revisit classic questions of cognitive psychology within a principled computational framework. We demonstrate that resource-rational models can reconcile the mind's most impressive cognitive skills with people's ostensive irrationality. Resource-rational analysis also provides a new way to connect psychological theory more deeply with artificial intelligence, economics, neuroscience, and linguistics.},

Memory and Cognition, 36(1), 201–216) presented evidence that the so-called ambiguity advantage [Traxler et al. (1998). Adjunct attachment is not a form of lexical ambiguity resolution. Journal of Memory and Language, 39(4), 558–592], which has been explained in terms of the Unrestricted Race Model, can equally well be explained by assuming underspecification in ambiguous conditions driven by task-demands. Specifically, if comprehension questions require that ambiguities be resolved, the parser tends to make an attachment: when questions are about superficial aspects of the target sentence, readers tend to pursue an underspecification strategy. It is reasonable to assume that individual differences in strategy will play a significant role in the application of such strategies, so that studying average behaviour may not be informative. In order to study the predictions of the good-enough processing theory, we implemented two versions of underspecification: the partial specification model (PSM), which is an implementation of the Swets et al. proposal, and a more parsimonious version, the non-specification model (NSM). We evaluate the relative fit of these two kinds of underspecification to Swets et al.'s data; as a baseline, we also fitted three models that assume no underspecification. We find that a model without underspecification provides a somewhat better fit than both underspecification models, while the NSM model provides a better fit than the PSM. We interpret the results as lack of unambiguous evidence in favour of underspecification; however, given that there is considerable existing evidence for good-enough processing in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that some underspecification might occur. Under this assumption, the results can be interpreted as tentative evidence for NSM over PSM. More generally, our work provides a method for choosing between models of real-time processes in sentence comprehension that make qualitative predictions about the relationship between several dependent variables. We believe that sentence processing research will greatly benefit from a wider use of such methods.},

  abstract = {What are the effects of word-by-word predictability on sentence processing times during the natural reading of a text? Although information complexity metrics such as surprisal and entropy reduction have been useful in addressing this question, these metrics tend to be estimated using computational language models, which require some degree of commitment to a particular theory of language processing. Taking a different approach, this study implemented a large-scale cumulative cloze task to collect word-by-word predictability data for 40 passages and compute surprisal and entropy reduction values in a theory-neutral manner. A separate group of participants read the same texts while their eye movements were recorded. Results showed that increases in surprisal and entropy reduction were both associated with increases in reading times. Furthermore, these effects did not depend on the global difficulty of the text. The findings suggest that surprisal and entropy reduction independently contribute to variation in reading times, as these metrics seem to capture different aspects of lexical predictability.},

This paper presents yet another use for these models: allocating more computation to more difficult inputs. In our model, an autoregressive model is used both to extract features and to predict observations in a stream of input observations. The surprisal of the input, measured as the negative log-likelihood of the current observation according to the autoregressive model, is used as a measure of input difficulty. This in turn determines whether a small, fast network, or a big, slow network, is used. Experiments on two speech recognition tasks show that our model can match the performance of a baseline in which the big network is always used with 15\% fewer FLOPs.},

Recently, Perea and Lupker (2004) demonstrated that, in Spanish, this transposed-letter prime advantage exists only when the transposed letters are consonants (C-C transpositions) and not when they are vowels (V-V transpositions). This vowel-consonant difference causes problems even for models that can successfully explain transposed-letter effects (e.g., SOLAR, Davis, 1999). In Experiment 1 in the present paper, we demonstrated a parallel result in a language with a different syllabic structure (English) in both a masked priming experiment and an unprimed lexical decision task in which the transposed letter strings (e.g., ADACEMY, ACEDAMY) were used as the nonwords. Results in Experiment 2 suggest that at least part of the reason for the vowel-consonant difference is because of the higher letter frequencies of the vowels. Possible alternative interpretations of the vowel-consonant difference are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a natural language parsing algorithm for unrestricted text which uses a probability-based scoring function to select the "best" parse of a sentence. The parser, Pearl, is a time-asynchronous bottom-up chart parser with Earley-type top-down prediction which pursues the highest-scoring theory in the chart, where the score of a theory represents the extent to which the context of the sentence predicts that interpretation. This parser differs from previous attempts at stochastic parsers in that it uses a richer form of conditional probabilities based on context to predict likelihood. Pearl also provides a framework for incorporating the results of previous work in part-of-speech assignment, unknown word models, and other probabilistic models of linguistic features into one parsing tool, interleaving these techniques instead of using the traditional pipeline architecture. In preliminary tests, Pearl has been successful at resolving part-of-speech and word (in speech processing) ambiguity, determining categories for unknown words, and selecting correct parses first using a very loosely fitting covering grammar.},

Several influential eye-tracking studies on syntactic reanalysis (Frazier and Rayner, 1982, Meseguer et al., 2002, Mitchell et al., 2008) have addressed this question by examining scanpaths, i.e., sequential patterns of eye fixations. However, in the absence of a suitable method for analyzing scanpaths, these studies relied on simplified dependent measures that are arguably ambiguous and hard to interpret. We address the theoretical question of repair strategy by developing a new method that quantifies scanpath similarity. Our method reveals several distinct fixation strategies associated with reanalysis that went undetected in a previously published data set (Meseguer et al., 2002). One prevalent pattern suggests re-parsing of the sentence, a strategy that has been discussed in the literature (Frazier \& Rayner, 1982); however, readers differed tremendously in how they orchestrated the various fixation strategies. Our results suggest that the human parsing system non-deterministically adopts different strategies when confronted with the disambiguating material in garden-path sentences.},

In particular, unsupervised learning techniques, such as the inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979) for estimating the parameters of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), tend to produce grammars that structure text in ways contrary to our linguistic intuitions. One effective way around this problem is to use hand-structured text like the Penn Treebank (Marcus, 1991) to constrain the learner: (Pereira and Schabes, 1992) demonstrate that the inside-outside algorithm can learn grammars effectively given such constraint, and currently the best performing parsers are trained on treebanks (Black et al., 1992; Magerman, 1995).},

  abstract = {A fundamental task of language acquisition is to extract abstract algebraic rules. Three experiments show that 7-month-old infants attend longer to sentences with unfamiliar structures than to sentences with familiar structures. The design of the artificial language task used in these experiments ensured that this discrimination could not be performed by counting, by a system that is sensitive only to transitional probabilities, or by a popular class of simple neural network models. Instead, these results suggest that infants can represent, extract, and generalize abstract algebraic rules.}

  abstract = {Self-paced reading tests (SPRs) are being increasingly adopted by second language (L2) researchers. Using SPR with L2 populations presents specific challenges, and its use is still evolving in L2 research (as well as in first language research, in many respects). Although the topic of several narrative overviews (Keating \& Jegerski, 2015; Roberts, 2016), we do not have a comprehensive picture of its usage in L2 research. Building on the growing body of systematic reviews of research practices in applied linguistics (e.g., Liu \& Brown, 2015; Plonsky, 2013), we report a methodological synthesis of the rationales, study contexts, and methodological decision making in L2 SPR research. Our comprehensive search yielded 74 SPRs used in L2 research. Each instrument was coded along 121 parameters, including: reported rationales and study characteristics, indicating the scope and nature of L2 SPR research agendas; design and analysis features and reporting practices, determining instrument validity and reliability; and materials transparency, affecting reproducibility and systematicity of agendas. Our findings indicate an urgent need to standardize the use and reporting of this technique, requiring empirical investigation to inform methodological decision making. We also identify several areas (e.g., study design, sample demographics, instrument construction, data analysis, and transparency) where SPR research could be improved to enrich our understanding of L2 processing, reading, and learning.},

In the IS context, an approximation ESS\textasciicircum{} of the theoretical ESS definition is widely applied, involving the inverse of the sum of the squares of the normalized importance weights. This formula, ESS\textasciicircum, has become an essential piece within Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, to assess the convenience of a resampling step. From another perspective, the expression ESS\textasciicircum{} is related to the Euclidean distance between the probability mass described by the normalized weights and the discrete uniform probability mass function (pmf). In this work, we derive other possible ESS functions based on different discrepancy measures between these two pmfs. Several examples are provided involving, for instance, the geometric mean of the weights, the discrete entropy (including the perplexity measure, already proposed in literature) and the Gini coefficient among others. We list five theoretical requirements which a generic ESS function should satisfy, allowing us to classify different ESS measures. We also compare the most promising ones by means of numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {This chapter is devoted to describing the class of the adaptive rejection sampling (ARS) schemes. These (theoretically) universal methods are very efficient samplers that update the proposal density whenever a generated sample is rejected in the RS test. In this way, they can produce i.i.d. samples from the target with an increasing acceptance rate that can converge to 1. As a by-product, these techniques also generate a sequence of proposal pdfs converging to the true shape of the target density. Another advantage of the ARS samplers is that, when they can be applied, the user only has to select a set of initial conditions. After the initialization, they are completely automatic, self-tuning algorithms (i.e., no parameters need to be adjusted by the user) regardless of the specific target density. However, the need to construct a suitable sequence of proposal densities restricts the practical applicability of this methodology. As a consequence, ARS schemes are often tailored to specific classes of target distributions. Indeed, the construction of the proposal is particularly hard in multidimensional spaces. Hence, ARS algorithms are usually designed only for drawing from univariate densities.},

  abstract = {In many languages and in a range of circumstances, a pronominal element may appear in a position in which one might have expected to see a gap bound by a clause-peripheral element (in relative clauses, constituent questions, cleft constructions, and the like). Such elements (often, but not exclusively, personal pronouns) are known as resumptive elements. Since they are formally pronouns but serve many of the core semantic functions associated with movement constructions, the study of resumptive elements raises fundamental questions about the nature of movement, about the nature of anaphoric elements and relationships, and about the nature of the interaction between these two spheres. These questions have been the focus of a great deal of work, beginning especially in the middle 1970s; this chapter surveys that work – the questions that have been asked, the phenomena that have been discovered, and the current state of thinking about the relevant questions. Consideration of the theoretical questions is organized around the asking of three questions: (i) what are the properties of resumptive elements; (ii) in what ways do they share, or fail to share, properties of movement constructions (island phenomena, reconstruction effects); and (iii) in what ways do they share, or fail to share, properties of anaphoric elements and interactions? In recent years especially, the study of resumption has been enriched by a great deal of experimental work, aimed not only at establishing some basic properties of resumptive elements, but also at better understanding the mechanisms involved in their production and comprehension. The chapter ends with a consideration of that work and its implications. Here, the central question that emerges quickly is that of how theories of competence and theories of performance interact with one another.},

  abstract = {Skilled readers are able to derive meaning from a stream of visual input with remarkable efficiency. In this article, we present the first evidence that statistical information latent in the linguistic environment can contribute to an account of reading behavior. In two eye-tracking studies, we demonstrate that the transitional probabilities between words have a measurable influence on fixation durations, and using a simple Bayesian statistical model, we show that lexical probabilities derived by combining transitional probability with the prior probability of a word's occurrence provide the most parsimonious account of the eye movement data. We suggest that the brain is able to draw upon statistical information in order to rapidly estimate the lexical probabilities of upcoming words: a computationally inexpensive mechanism that may underlie proficient reading.},

The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias–variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton–proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists may be able to contribute.},

On the other hand, the lower-probability text generated by stochastic methods is perceived as more human-like. In this note, we offer an explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing language generation through an information-theoretic lens. Specifically, we posit that human-like language should contain an amount of information (quantified as negative log-probability) that is close to the entropy of the distribution over natural strings. Further, we posit that language with substantially more (or less) information is undesirable. We provide preliminary empirical evidence in favor of this hypothesis; quality ratings of both human and machine-generated text—covering multiple tasks and common decoding strategies—suggest high-quality text has an information content significantly closer to the entropy than we would expect by chance.},

This discrepancy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years. In this work, we posit that the abstraction of natural language generation as a discrete stochastic process—which allows for an information-theoretic analysis—can provide new insights into the behavior of probabilistic language generators, for example, why high-probability texts can be dull or repetitive. Humans use language as a means of communicating information, aiming to do so in a simultaneously efficient and error-minimizing manner; in fact, psycholinguistics research suggests humans choose each word in a string with this subconscious goal in mind. We formally define the set of strings that meet this criterion: Those for which each word has an information content close to the expected information content, namely, the conditional entropy of our model. We then propose a simple and efficient procedure for enforcing this criterion when generating from probabilistic models, which we call locally typical sampling. Automatic and human evaluations show that, in comparison to nucleus and top-k sampling, locally typical sampling offers competitive performance (in both abstractive summarization and story generation) in terms of quality while consistently reducing degenerate repetitions.},

The notions of dependency relations and dependency structure are introduced and substantiated, and the advantages of dependency representation are demonstrated by applying it to a number of popular linguistic problems, e.g. grammatical subject and ergative construction. A wide array of linguistic data is used – the well-known (Dyirbal), the less known (Lezgian), and the more recent (Alutor). Several "exotic" cases of Russian are discussed to show how dependency can be used to solve difficult technical problems. The book is not only formal and rigorous, but also strongly theory-oriented and data-based. Special attention is paid to linguistic terminology, specifically to its logical consistency. The dependency formalism is presented within the framework of a new semantics-oriented general linguistic theory, Meaning-Text theory.},

We use state-ofthe-art machine learning tools to investigate which of these three accounts is best supported by the evidence. GPT-3, a neural language model trained to compute the conditional probability of any word based on the words that precede it, was used to operationalize contextual predictability. In particular, we used an information-theoretic construct known as surprisal (the negative logarithm of the conditional probability). Contextual semantic similarity was operationalized by using two high-quality co-occurrence-derived vector-based meaning representations for words: GloVe and fastText. The cosine between the vector representation of the sentence frame and final word was used to derive contextual cosine similarity estimates. A series of regression models were constructed, where these variables, along with cloze probability and plausibility ratings, were used to predict single trial N400 amplitudes recorded from healthy adults as they read sentences whose final word varied in its predictability, plausibility, and semantic relationship to the likeliest sentence completion. Statistical model comparison indicated GPT-3 surprisal provided the best account of N400 amplitude and suggested that apparently disparate N400 effects of expectancy, plausibility, and contextual semantic similarity can be reduced to variation in the predictability of words. The results are argued to support predictive coding in the human language network.},

  abstract = {Accounts of human language comprehension propose different mathematical relationships between the contextual probability of a word and how difficult it is to process, including linear, logarithmic, and super-logarithmic ones. However, the empirical evidence favoring any of these over the others is mixed, appearing to vary depending on the index of processing difficulty used and the approach taken to calculate contextual probability. To help disentangle these results, we focus on the mathematical relationship between corpus-derived contextual probability and the N400, a neural index of processing difficulty. Specifically, we use 37 contemporary transformer language models to calculate the contextual probability of stimuli from 6 experimental studies of the N400, and test whether N400 amplitude is best predicted by a linear, logarithmic, super-logarithmic, or sub-logarithmic transformation of the probabilities calculated using these language models, as well as combinations of these transformed metrics. We replicate the finding that on some datasets, a combination of linearly and logarithmically-transformed probability can predict N400 amplitude better than either metric alone. In addition, we find that overall, the best single predictor of N400 amplitude is sub-logarithmically-transformed probability, which for almost all language models and datasets explains all the variance in N400 amplitude otherwise explained by the linear and logarithmic transformations. This is a novel finding that is not predicted by any current theoretical accounts, and thus one that we argue is likely to play an important role in increasing our understanding of how the statistical regularities of language impact language comprehension.},

We introduce Potto, the first differentiable first-order programming language to soundly differentiate parametric discontinuities. We present a denotational semantics for programs and program derivatives and show the two accord. We describe the implementation of Potto, which enables separate compilation of programs. Our prototype implementation overcomes previous compile-time bottlenecks achieving an 88.1x and 441.2x speed up in compile time and a 2.5x and 7.9x speed up in runtime, respectively, on two increasingly large image stylization benchmarks. We showcase Potto by implementing a prototype differentiable renderer with separately compiled shaders.},

Instead of computing the likelihood of the label given the input (referred as direct models), channel models compute the conditional probability of the input given the label, and are thereby required to explain every word in the input. We use channel models for recently proposed few-shot learning methods with no or very limited updates to the language model parameters, via either in-context demonstration or prompt tuning. Our experiments show that, for both methods, channel models significantly outperform their direct counterparts, which we attribute to their stability, i.e., lower variance and higher worst-case accuracy. We also present extensive ablations that provide recommendations for when to use channel prompt tuning instead of other competitive models (e.g., direct head tuning): channel prompt tuning is preferred when the number of training examples is small, labels in the training data are imbalanced, or generalization to unseen labels is required.},

This method, "Expectation Propagation," unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and varitmce, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be donvincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers.},

Further, the precise way in which data influence learning on a large scale is unknown—experimental results reveal that children can rapidly learn words from single instances as well as by aggregating ambiguous information across multiple situations. We analyze Wordbank, a large cross-linguistic dataset of word acquisition norms, using a statistical waiting time model to quantify the role of data in early language learning, building off Hidaka (2013). We find that the model both fits and accurately predicts the shape of children’s growth curves. Further analyses of model parameters suggest a primarily data-driven account of early word learning. The parameters of the model directly characterize both the amount of data required and the rate at which informative data occurs. With high statistical certainty, words require on the order of ∼ 10 learning instances, which occur on average once every two months. Our method is extremely simple, statistically principled, and broadly applicable to modeling data-driven learning effects in development.},

  abstract = {This thesis is a study of the interpretation of pronouns, in particular, of the interpretive differences between overt and empty pronouns in certain configurations involving binding phenomena. We have captured these differences by means of a constraint which we have called the Overt Pronoun Constraint (Ope) and which is operative at the level of Logical Form. Informally, the ope states that overt pronouns that are in contrastive distribution with empty ones cannot link to formal variables (where by formal variable we roughly mean WH and QR traces). Some theoretically interesting consequences follow from the ope. For one thing, it shows that the lexical realization (or not) of a pronoun carries with it important interpretive consequences hence arguing for the view that the so called Null Subject Parameter has relevant LF properties. Indeed, if overt pronouns Cof the type nlentioned) cannot link to formal variables then they cannot be interpreted as bound variables. However, there are certain configurations in which overt pronouns can act as bound variables, and these configurations involve the presence of an extra bound pronoun which serves as a gate for binding. We will show that these cases present us with empirical evidence in favor of a Linking theory of binding (as outlined in Higginbotham 1983). Furthermore we use the ope as a diagnostic for both the existence and nature of certain controversial empty categories that occur in constructions such as clitic constructions, restructuring constructions, empty operator binding constructions, etc. The case of sloppy identity is also analyzed in terms of the ope. Although our analysis is based on the behavior of Spanish pronouns, we extend it to cover the behavior of pronouns in other Romance languages (Italian, Portuguese, Catalan) as well as in languages like Japanese and Chinese. The hope is thus parametrized to account for the subtle differences which underlie the striking similarities between the languages studied.},

This tutorial introduces Bayesian multilevel modeling for the specific analysis of speech data, using the brms package developed in R.

Results  We first give an introductory overview of the Bayesian framework and multilevel modeling. We then show how Bayesian multilevel models can be fitted using the probabilistic programming language Stan and the R package brms, which provides an intuitive formula syntax. Conclusions  Through this tutorial, we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework for statistical modeling and provide a detailed case study, with complete source code for full reproducibility of the analyses (https://osf.io/dpzcb/).

  abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can ample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

In the grand scheme of history of artificial intelligence (AI), this is surely a minor event. The field this scientific society represents has been thriving for quite some time. No doubt the society itself will make solid contributions to the health of our field. But it is too much to expect a presidential address to have a major impact. So what is the role of the presidential address and what is the significance of the first one? I believe its role is to set a tone, to provide an emphasis. I think the role of the first address is to take a stand about what that tone and emphasis should be-set expectations for future addresses and to communicate to my fellow presidents. Only two foci are really possible for a presidential address: the state of the society or the state of the science. I believe the latter to be correct focus. AAAI itself, its nature and its relationship to the larger society that surrounds it, are surely important. However, our main business is to help AI become a science -- albeit a science with a strong engineering flavor. Thus, though a president's address cannot be narrow or highly technical, it can certainly address a substantive issue. That is what I propose to do.},

Not everyone will agree on a single set of mechanisms that will explain the full range of human cognition, but such theories are within reach and we should strive to articulate them.In this book, Newell makes the case for unified theories by setting forth a candidate. After reviewing the foundational concepts of cognitive science--knowledge, representation, computation, symbols, architecture, intelligence, and search--Newell introduces Soar, an architecture for general cognition. A pioneer system in artificial intelligence, Soar is the first problem solver to create its own subgoals and learn continuously from its own experience.Newell shows how Soar's ability to operate within the real-time constraints of intelligent behavior, such as immediate-response and item-recognition tasks, illustrates important characteristics of the human cognitive structure. Throughout, Soar remains an exemplar: we know only enough to work toward a fully developed theory of cognition, but Soar's success so far establishes the viability of the enterprise.Given its integrative approach, Unified Theories of Cognition will be of tremendous interest to researchers in a variety of fields, including cognitive science, artificial intelligence, psychology, and computer science. This exploration of the nature of mind, one of the great problems of philosophy, should also transcend disciplines and attract a large scientific audience.},

  abstract = {We introduce the weighted likelihood bootstrap (WLB) as a way to simulate approximately from a posterior distribution. This method is often easy to implement, requiring only an algorithm for calculating the maximum likelihood estimator, such as iteratively reweighted least squares. In the generic weighting scheme, the WLB is first order correct under quite general conditions. Inaccuracies can be removed by using the WLB as a source of samples in the sampling-importance resampling (SIR) algorithm, which also allows incorporation of particular prior information. The SIR-adjusted WLB can be a competitive alternative to other integration methods in certain models. Asymptotic expansions elucidate the second-order properties of the WLB, which is a generalization of Rubin's Bayesian bootstrap. The calculation of approximate Bayes factors for model comparison is also considered. We note that, given a sample simulated from the posterior distribution, the required marginal likelihood may be simulation consistently estimated by the harmonic mean of the associated likelihood values; a modification of this estimator that avoids instability is also noted. These methods provide simple ways of calculating approximate Bayes factors and posterior model probabilities for a very wide class of models.},

Additionally, we find that learning variances of the reverse diffusion process allows sampling with an order of magnitude fewer forward passes with a negligible difference in sample quality, which is important for the practical deployment of these models. We additionally use precision and recall to compare how well DDPMs and GANs cover the target distribution. Finally, we show that the sample quality and likelihood of these models scale smoothly with model capacity and training compute, making them easily scalable.

Such data points can be handled in a variety of ways (e.g., trimming, data transformation), each of which may influence study results in a different manner. This two-phase study sought, first, to systematically review outlier handling techniques found in studies that involve SPR and, second, to re-analyze raw data from SPR tasks to understand the impact of those techniques. Toward these ends, in Phase I, a sample of 104 studies that employed SPR tasks was collected and coded for different outlier treatments. As found in Marsden et al. (2018), wide variability was observed across the sample in terms of selection of time and standard deviation (SD)-based boundaries for determining what constitutes a legitimate reading time (RT). In Phase II, the raw data from the SPR studies in Phase I were requested from the authors. Nineteen usable datasets were obtained and re-analyzed using data transformations, SD boundaries, trimming, and winsorizing, in order to test their relative effectiveness for normalizing SPR reaction time data. The results suggested that, in the vast majority of cases, logarithmic transformation circumvented the need for SD boundaries, which blindly eliminate or alter potentially legitimate data. The results also indicated that choice of SD boundary had little influence on the data and revealed no meaningful difference between trimming and winsorizing, implying that blindly removing data from SPR analyses might be unnecessary. Suggestions are provided for future research involving SPR data and the handling of outliers in second language (L2) research more generally.},

  abstract = {Parsing algorithms that process the input from left to right and construct a single derivation have often been considered inadequate for natural language parsing because of the massive ambiguity typically found in natural language grammars. Nevertheless, it has been shown that such algorithms, combined with treebank-induced classifiers, can be used to build highly accurate disambiguating parsers, in particular for dependency-based syntactic representations. In this article, we first present a general framework for describing and analyzing algorithms for deterministic incremental dependency parsing, formalized as transition systems. We then describe and analyze two families of such algorithms: stack-based and list-based algorithms. In the former family, which is restricted to projective dependency structures, we describe an arc-eager and an arc-standard variant; in the latter family, we present a projective and a non-projective variant. For each of the four algorithms, we give proofs of correctness and complexity. In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation of all algorithms in combination with SVM classifiers for predicting the next parsing action, using data from thirteen languages. We show that all four algorithms give competitive accuracy, although the non-projective list-based algorithm generally outperforms the projective algorithms for languages with a non-negligible proportion of non-projective constructions. However, the projective algorithms often produce comparable results when combined with the technique known as pseudo-projective parsing. The linear time complexity of the stack-based algorithms gives them an advantage with respect to efficiency both in learning and in parsing, but the projective list-based algorithm turns out to be equally efficient in practice. Moreover, when the projective algorithms are used to implement pseudo-projective parsing, they sometimes become less efficient in parsing (but not in learning) than the non-projective list-based algorithm. Although most of the algorithms have been partially described in the literature before, this is the first comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the algorithms within a unified framework.},

This leads to the development of a computational model of word recognition, the Bayesian reader. The Bayesian reader successfully simulates some of the most significant data on human reading. The model accounts for the nature of the function relating word frequency to reaction time and identification threshold, the effects of neighborhood density and its interaction with frequency, and the variation in the pattern of neighborhood density effects seen in different experimental tasks. Both the general behavior of the model and the way the model predicts different patterns of results in different tasks follow entirely from the assumption that human readers approximate optimal Bayesian decision makers.

McKoon (2004) suggested much of what goes on in lexical decision is attributable to decision processes and may not be particularly informative about word recognition. They proposed that lexical decision should be characterized by a decision process, taking the form of a drift-diffusion model (R. Ratcliff, 1978), that operates on the output of lexical model. The present article argues that the distinction between perception and decision making is unnecessary and that it is possible to give a unified account of both lexical processing and decision making. This claim is supported by formal arguments and reinforced by simulations showing how the Bayesian Reader model (D. Norris, 2006) can be extended to fit the data on reaction time distributions collected by Ratcliff, Gomez, and McKoon simply by adding extra sources of noise. The Bayesian Reader gives an integrated explanation of both word recognition and decision making, using fewer parameters than the diffusion model. It can be thought of as a Bayesian diffusion model, which subsumes Ratcliff's drift-diffusion model as a special case. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Psycholinguistic research has focused much attention on the factors that influence structural ambiguity resolution, under the assumption that meaning is derived from a selected syntactic representation in a systematic, compositional way. Problematically, however, researchers have increasingly observed examples suggesting that perceptions of sentence acceptability and meaning are not always straightforwardly constrained by logical semantics. Most English speakers, for example, initially accept the sentence More people have been to Berlin than I have until asked to explain more clearly what it means, at which point its meaninglessness becomes obvious. Meanwhile, the sentence No head injury is too trivial to ignore is overwhelmingly perceived to mean exactly the opposite of its implausible grammar-based meaning, an error that is only readily detected with extended conscious effort. The goal of this thesis is uncover what these “semantic illusions” tell us about semantic processing by identifying the locus of nonveridical processing. In spite of appearances I argue that it is impossible to explain perceptions of and reactions to these illusion sentences without referencing properties that influence their logical form; this suggests, contrary to existing proposals, that the illusion is generated by online computations associated with, not external to, the grammar, and that nonveridical perceptions are induced by processing mechanisms responsible for navigating the logical form of sentences that contain probable speech errors and/or those that fall at the outer boundaries of computational tractability. Because the source of these illusions is not well understood, a more general goal of this work is to establish their fundamental properties, including the nature of their percept(s) and the properties that modulate that percept, to pave the way for future research.},

This division of labor leads to a tradeoff: more structure-building means less need to store while more storage means less need to compute structure. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model called fragment grammar to explore the optimum balance between structure-building and reuse. The model is developed in the context of stochastic functional programming (SFP) and in particular using a probabilistic variant of Lisp known as the Church programming language (Goodman, Mansinghka, Roy, Bonawitz, \& Tenenbaum, 2008). We show how to formalize several probabilistic models of language structure using Church, and how fragment grammar generalizes one of them---adaptor grammars (Johnson, Griffiths, \& Goldwater, 2007). We conclude with experimental data with adults and preliminary evaluations of the model on natural language corpus data.},

  abstract = {A much-celebrated aspect of language is the way in which it allows us to make "infinite use of finite means" (von Humboldt, 1836). This property is made possible because language is fundamentally a productive computational system: Novel expressions can be composed from a large inventory of stored, reusable parts. For any given language, however, there are many more potential ways of forming novel expressions than can actually be used in practice. For example, English contains suffixes that are highly productive (e.g., -ness ; Lady-Gagaesqueness, pine-scentedness), but also contains suffixes which can only be reused in specific, existing words (e.g., -th; truth, width, warmth). How are such differences in productivity and reusability represented? How can the child acquire this system of knowledge? This thesis presents a formal model of productivity and reuse which treats the problem as a structure-by-structure inference in a Bayesian framework. The model—Fragment Grammars, a generalization of Adaptor Grammars (Johnson et al., 2007a)—is built around two proposals. The first is that anything that can be computed can be stored. The specific computational mechanism by which this is accomplished, stochastic memoization, is inherited from Adaptor Grammars (Goodman et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2007a). The second proposal is that any stored item can include subparts which must be computed productively. This is made possible by the computational mechanism of stochastically lazy evaluation, introduced in the thesis. Throughout the thesis, Fragment Grammars are systematically compared to four other probabilistic models of productivity and reuse which formalize historical proposals from the linguistics and psycholinguistics literatures. The five models are evaluated on two very different sub-systems of English morphology: the English past tense, which is characterized by a sharp dichotomy in productivity between regular (i.e., +ed) and irregular (e.g., sing/sang) forms, and English derivational morphology, which is characterized by a graded cline from very productive (e.g., -ness) to very unproductive (e.g., -th). The thesis examines many aspects of these two domains including: performance on past-tense inflection, past-tense processing phenomena, developmental overregularization, the productivity of derivational suffixes, ordering restrictions on derivational suffixes, and base-driven selectional restrictions on suffix combinations.},

  abstract = {A proposal for a formal model, Fragment Grammars, that treats productivity and reuse as the target of inference in a probabilistic framework.Language allows us to express and comprehend an unbounded number of thoughts. This fundamental and much-celebrated property is made possible by a division of labor between a large inventory of stored items (e.g., affixes, words, idioms) and a computational system that productively combines these stored units on the fly to create a potentially unlimited array of new expressions. A language learner must discover a language's productive, reusable units and determine which computational processes can give rise to new expressions. But how does the learner differentiate between the reusable, generalizable units (for example, the affix -ness, as in coolness, orderliness, cheapness) and apparent units that do not actually generalize in practice (for example, -th, as in warmth but not coolth)? In this book, Timothy O'Donnell proposes a formal computational model, Fragment Grammars, to answer these questions. This model treats productivity and reuse as the target of inference in a probabilistic framework, asking how an optimal agent can make use of the distribution of forms in the linguistic input to learn the distribution of productive word-formation processes and reusable units in a given language.O'Donnell compares this model to a number of other theoretical and mathematical models, applying them to the English past tense and English derivational morphology, and showing that Fragment Grammars unifies a number of superficially distinct empirical phenomena in these domains and justifies certain seemingly ad hoc assumptions in earlier theories.},

  abstract = {Expectation-based theories of sentence processing posit that processing difficulty is determined by predictability in context. While predictability quantified via surprisal has gained empirical support, this representation-agnostic measure leaves open the question of how to best approximate the human comprehender's latent probability model. This article first describes an incremental left-corner parser that incorporates information about common linguistic abstractions such as syntactic categories, predicate-argument structure, and morphological rules as a computational-level model of sentence processing. The article then evaluates a variety of structural parsers and deep neural language models as cognitive models of sentence processing by comparing the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on self-paced reading, eye-tracking, and fMRI data collected during real-time language processing. The results show that surprisal estimates from the proposed left-corner processing model deliver comparable and often superior fits to self-paced reading and eye-tracking data when compared to those from neural language models trained on much more data. This may suggest that the strong linguistic generalizations made by the proposed processing model may help predict humanlike processing costs that manifest in latency-based measures, even when the amount of training data is limited. Additionally, experiments using Transformer-based language models sharing the same primary architecture and training data show a surprising negative correlation between parameter count and fit to self-paced reading and eye-tracking data. These findings suggest that large-scale neural language models are making weaker generalizations based on patterns of lexical items rather than stronger, more humanlike generalizations based on linguistic structure.},

First, regression analyses show a strictly monotonic, positive log-linear relationship between perplexity and fit to reading times for the more recently released five GPT-Neo variants and eight OPT variants on two separate datasets, replicating earlier results limited to just GPT-2 (Oh et al., 2022). Subsequently, analysis of residual errors reveals a systematic deviation of the larger variants, such as underpredicting reading times of named entities and making compensatory overpredictions for reading times of function words such as modals and conjunctions. These results suggest that the propensity of larger Transformer-based models to ‘memorize’ sequences during training makes their surprisal estimates diverge from humanlike expectations, which warrants caution in using pre-trained language models to study human language processing.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that as Transformer-based language models become larger and are trained on very large amounts of data, the fit of their surprisal estimates to naturalistic human reading times degrades. The current work presents a series of analyses showing that word frequency is a key explanatory factor underlying these two trends. First, residual errors from four language model families on four corpora show that the inverse correlation between model size and fit to reading times is the strongest on the subset of least frequent words, which is driven by excessively accurate predictions of larger model variants.

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that as Transformer-based language models become larger and are trained on very large amounts of data, the fit of their surprisal estimates to naturalistic human reading times degrades. The current work presents a series of analyses showing that word frequency is a key explanatory factor underlying these two trends. First, residual errors from four language model families on four corpora show that the inverse correlation between model size and fit to reading times is the strongest on the subset of least frequent words, which is driven by excessively accurate predictions of larger model variants. Additionally, training dynamics reveal that during later training steps, all model variants learn to predict rare words and that larger model variants do so more accurately, which explains the detrimental effect of both training data amount and model size on fit to reading times. Finally, a feature attribution analysis demonstrates that larger model variants are able to accurately predict rare words based on both an effectively longer context window size as well as stronger local associations compared to smaller model variants.

The Gibbs free energy and its relation to these approximations, as well as double-loop algorithms for its minimization, are briefly discussed.

  abstract = {Perfectly rational decision-makers maximize expected utility, but crucially ignore the resource costs incurred when determining optimal actions. Here, we propose a thermodynamically inspired formalization of bounded rational decision-making where information processing is modelled as state changes in thermodynamic systems that can be quantified by differences in free energy. By optimizing a free energy, bounded rational decision-makers trade off expected utility gains and information-processing costs measured by the relative entropy. As a result, the bounded rational decision-making problem can be rephrased in terms of well-known variational principles from statistical physics. In the limit when computational costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is recovered. We discuss links to existing decision-making frameworks and applications to human decision-making experiments that are at odds with expected utility theory. Since most of the mathematical machinery can be borrowed from statistical physics, the main contribution is to re-interpret the formalism of thermodynamic free-energy differences in terms of bounded rational decision-making and to discuss its relationship to human decision-making experiments.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that inverse marking and portmanteau agreement are in complementary distribution in Algonquin: inverse marking is possible only in contexts where portmanteau agreement is not. This correlation holds despite intralanguage variation in both phenomena. The paper proposes that the two phenomena pattern together because both are determined by the outcome of the Agree operation on Infl. When Infl enters a Multiple Agree relation with both arguments, the realization of portmanteau agreement morphology is possible. When Infl agrees only with the object, it duplicates the result of an earlier object agreement operation on Voice. The presence of identical features on Infl and Voice triggers an impoverishment operation that deletes the features of Voice, resulting in its spellout as an underspecified elsewhere form—which is the exponent that we know descriptively as the inverse marker. This analysis explains why inverse marking and portmanteau agreement never co-occur in Algonquin: the two phenomena are determined by alternative outcomes of the Agree operation on Infl. The analysis also enables a simple account of the intralanguage variation in the patterning of the two phenomena, which is shown to follow from variation in the specification of the probe on Infl.},

  abstract = {So-called “depth charge” sentences (No head injury is too trivial to be ignored) are interpreted by the vast majority of speakers to mean the opposite of what their compositional semantics would dictate. The semantic inversion that is observed for sentences of this type is the strongest and most persistent linguistic illusion known to the field ( Wason \&amp; Reich, 1979). However, it has recently been argued that the preferred interpretation arises not because of a prevailing failure of the processing system, but rather because the non-compositional meaning is grammaticalized in the form of a stored construction ( Cook \&amp; Stevenson, 2010; Fortuin, 2014). In a series of five experiments, we investigate whether the depth charge effect is better explained by processing failure due to memory overload (the overloading hypothesis) or by the existence of an underlying grammaticalized construction with two available meanings (the ambiguity hypothesis). To our knowledge, our experiments are the first to explore the on-line processing profile of depth charge sentences. Overall, the data are consistent with specific variants of the ambiguity and overloading hypotheses while providing evidence against other variants. As an extension of the overloading hypothesis, we suggest two heuristic processes that may ultimately yield the incorrect reading when compositional processing is suspended for strategic reasons.},

It has been suggested that such effects occur either because sentence processing occurs in a bottom-up, self-organized manner rather than under constant grammatical supervision, or because local coherence can disrupt processing due to readers maintaining uncertainty about previous input. We report the results of an eye-tracking study in which subjects read German grammatical and ungrammatical sentences that either contained a locally coherent substring or not and gave binary grammaticality judgments. In our data, local coherence affected on-line processing immediately at the point of the manipulation. There was, however, no indication that local coherence led to illusions of grammaticality (a prediction of self-organization), and only weak, inconclusive support for local coherence leading to targeted regressions to critical context words (a prediction of the uncertain-input approach). We discuss implications for self-organized and noisy-channel models of local coherence.},

  abstract = {Sentences in natural language are routinely interpreted as stronger than would be expected from the lexical meanings of the overt lexical items alone. This has led to the postulation of exhaustification (strengthening) mechanisms in pragmatics and semantics. Such exhaustivity effects have largely been discussed for logical vocabulary, focused expressions, and predicates forming entailment scales with other predicates. Relying on recent work on additive particles, I argue that exhaustivity is at play in a significantly broader array of meanings than previously appreciated: all predicates are exhaustified, in all sentences. That is, the intuited meanings of predicates in sentences are stronger than their lexical–conceptual meanings. I focus on 'taxonomic' predicates, which do not form entailment scales with other predicates. I make this case first and foremost based on apparently banal contradictions like This comedy is a tragedy or The white flag is green. While these contradictions are intuitively due to the meanings of the predicates, the interaction of these predicates with additive particles (This comedy is also a tragedy) and conjunction (This play is both a comedy and a tragedy) is argued to show that the predicates are underlyingly consistent. As such, the contradiction observed in the basic case must result from exhaustification.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliably generating highly structured outputs, such as program code, mathematical formulas, or well-formed markup. Constrained decoding approaches mitigate this problem by greedily restricting what tokens an LLM can output at each step to guarantee that the output matches a given constraint. Specifically, in grammar-constrained decoding (GCD), the LLM's output must follow a given grammar. In this paper we demonstrate that GCD techniques (and in general constrained decoding techniques) can distort the LLM's distribution, leading to outputs that are grammatical but appear with likelihoods that are not proportional to the ones given by the LLM, and so ultimately are low-quality. We call the problem of aligning sampling with a grammar constraint, grammar-aligned decoding (GAD), and propose adaptive sampling with approximate expected futures (ASAp), a decoding algorithm that guarantees the output to be grammatical while provably producing outputs that match the conditional probability of the LLM's distribution conditioned on the given grammar constraint. Our algorithm uses prior sample outputs to soundly overapproximate the future grammaticality of different output prefixes. Our evaluation on code generation and structured NLP tasks shows how ASAp often produces outputs with higher likelihood (according to the LLM's distribution) than existing GCD techniques, while still enforcing the desired grammatical constraints.},

  abstract = {Linguistic illusions have provided valuable insights into how we mentally navigate complex representations in memory during language comprehension. Two notable cases involve illusory licensing of agreement and negative polarity items (NPIs), where comprehenders fleetingly accept sentences with unlicensed agreement or an unlicensed NPI, but judge those same sentences as unacceptable after more reflection. Existing accounts have argued that illusions are a consequence of faulty memory access processes, and make the additional assumption that the encoding of the sentence remains fixed over time. This paper challenges the predictions made by these accounts, which assume that illusions should generalize to a broader set of structural environments and a wider range of syntactic and semantic phenomena. We show across seven reading-time and acceptability judgment experiments that NPI illusions can be reliably switched “on” and “off”, depending on the amount of time from when the potential licensor is processed until the NPI is encountered. But we also find that the same profile does not extend to agreement illusions. This contrast suggests that the mechanisms responsible for switching the NPI illusion on and off are not shared across all illusions. We argue that the contrast reflects changes over time in the encoding of the semantic/pragmatic representations that can license NPIs. Just as optical illusions have been informative about the visual system, selective linguistic illusions are informative not only about the nature of the access mechanisms, but also about the nature of the encoding mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Robust documentation is a major goal of documentary linguistics. Recognizing spoken language as a multimodal phenomenon, researchers working in this field broadly agree that video is an improvement over audio-only recording. At the same time, video is limited by the format’s frame, which permits only a relatively small portion of the visual field to be recorded at any given time. This results in much data being lost, as the documenter must decide where to aim their camera, necessarily leaving out more than they record. In this dissertation, I apply 360º video to language documentation for the first time. 360º video, which is one variety of virtual reality, improves upon traditional video by drastically expanding the frame, recording in all directions surrounding the camera. In this way, a maximum of visual data is recorded, and there is no need for the camera to be redirected as participants take turns speaking or move around the space. I recorded over 10 hours of 360º video with ambisonic audio, containing mostly naturalistic conversation in the Akwesasne variety of Kanien’kéha (Mohawk), an endangered Northern Iroquoian language spoken in New York State, Ontario, and Quebec. Most of the existing documentation of Kanien’kéha outside of this corpus is formal or non-naturalistic. The resulting corpus thus serves a dual purpose: it is both a demonstration of the capabilities of 360º video for language documentation, and a contribution to the documentation of Kanien’kéha. This dissertation includes a brief grammatical description of Kanien’kéha phonology and morphology, a discussion of the interplay between technology and language documentation throughout North American history, an exploration of the significance of 360º video to documentary linguistics, a brief analysis of gesture and intonation in the present corpus, and an assessment of the suitability of ambisonic audio for linguistic analysis. Directions for potential future research are indicated throughout.},

  abstract = {Transposed-letter (TL) nonwords (e.g.,jugde) can be easily misperceived as words, a fact that is somewhat inconsistent with the letter-position-coding schemes employed by most current models of visual word recognition. To examine this issue further, we conducted four masked semantic/associative priming experiments, using a lexical decision task. In Experiment 1, the related primes could be words, TL-internal nonwords, or replacement-letter (RL) nonwords (e.g.,judge, jugde, orjudpe, respectively; the target would be COURT). Relative to an unrelated condition, masked TL-internal primes produced a significant semantic/associative priming effect, an effect that was only slightly smaller than the priming effect for word primes. No effect, however, was observed for RL-nonword primes. In Experiment 2, the TL-nonword primes were created by switching the two final letters of the primes (e.g.,judeg). The results again showed a semantic/associative priming effect for word primes, but not for TL-final nonword primes or for RL-nonword primes. Experiment 3 replicated the associative/semantic priming effect for TL-internal nonword primes, with, again, no effect for TL-final nonword primes. Finally, Experiment 4 again failed to yield a priming effect for TL-final nonword primes. The implications of these results for the choice of a letter-position-coding scheme in visual word recognition models are discussed.},

This distribution approximately follows a simple mathematical form known as Zipf ’ s law. This article first shows that human language has a highly complex, reliable structure in the frequency distribution over and above this classic law, although prior data visualization methods have obscured this fact. A number of empirical phenomena related to word frequencies are then reviewed. These facts are chosen to be informative about the mechanisms giving rise to Zipf’s law and are then used to evaluate many of the theoretical explanations of Zipf’s law in language. No prior account straightforwardly explains all the basic facts or is supported with independent evaluation of its underlying assumptions. To make progress at understanding why language obeys Zipf’s law, studies must seek evidence beyond the law itself, testing assumptions and evaluating novel predictions with new, independent data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Over the past two decades, numerous studies have demonstrated how less-predictable (i.e., higher surprisal) words take more time to read. In general, these studies have implicitly assumed the reading process is purely responsive: Readers observe a new word and allocate time to process it as required. We argue that prior results are also compatible with a reading process that is at least partially anticipatory: Readers could make predictions about a future word and allocate time to process it based on their expectation. In this work, we operationalize this anticipation as a word’s contextual entropy. We assess the effect of anticipation on reading by comparing how well surprisal and contextual entropy predict reading times on four naturalistic reading datasets: two self-paced and two eye-tracking. Experimentally, across datasets and analyses, we find substantial evidence for effects of contextual entropy over surprisal on a word’s reading time (RT): In fact, entropy is sometimes better than surprisal in predicting a word’s RT. Spillover effects, however, are generally not captured by entropy, but only by surprisal. Further, we hypothesize four cognitive mechanisms through which contextual entropy could impact RTs—three of which we are able to design experiments to analyze. Overall, our results support a view of reading that is not just responsive, but also anticipatory.1},

In this thesis, we investigate the existence, the nature, and the impact of such a pressure in natural languages' lexicons. We investigate the existence of this pressure by (i) estimating what optimal word lengths would be using coding theory, (ii) proposing pressure-free baselines and estimating their word lengths, and then (iii) comparing natural lexicons to both these optimal and pressure-free artificial lexicons. We investigate the nature of this pressure by comparing multiple ways in which communicative efficiency can be operationalised; we formalise it as either a pressure to shorten utterances, or a pressure to keep information rates as close as possible to an unknown communication channel capacity. Finally, we study the impact of this pressure on cross-linguistic differences in word lengths and on the ratio of homophones in natural languages. Overall, our results support a Zipfian view of communicative efficiency, in which lexicons are pressured towards having utterances that are as short as possible. Our results, however, also highlight the existence of competing constraints and pressures in how lexicons are structured: (i) a language's phonotactic complexity seems to bottleneck the extent to which economy of expression can optimise a lexicon, and (ii) a pressure for clarity seems to keep the ratio of homophones in a language close to chance.},

Several studies found evidence that comprehenders decide whether a given utterance should be taken at face value in accordance with principles of Bayesian rationality, by weighing the prior probability of potential interpretations against the degree to which they are (in)consistent with the literal form of the utterance. While all of these results are consistent with string-edit noise models, many error processes are known to be sensitive to the underlying linguistic structure of the intended utterance. Here, we explore the case of exchange errors and provide experimental evidence that comprehenders' noise model is structure-sensitive. Our results add further support to the noisy-channel theory of language comprehension, extend the set of known noise operations to include positional exchanges, and show that comprehenders' noise models are well-adapted to structure-sensitive sources of signal corruption.},

  abstract = {The dominant paradigm for high-performance models in novel NLP tasks today is direct specialization for the task via training from scratch or fine-tuning large pre-trained models. But does direct specialization capture how humans approach novel language tasks? We hypothesize that human performance is better characterized by flexible inference through composition of basic computational motifs available to the human language user. To test this hypothesis, we formulate a set of novel fragmentary text completion tasks, and compare the behavior of three direct-specialization models against a new model we introduce, GibbsComplete, which composes two basic computational motifs central to contemporary models: masked and autoregressive word prediction. We conduct three types of evaluation: human judgments of completion quality, satisfaction of syntactic constraints imposed by the input fragment, and similarity to human behavior in the structural statistics of the completions. With no task-specific parameter tuning, GibbsComplete performs comparably to direct-specialization models in the first two evaluations, and outperforms all direct-specialization models in the third evaluation. These results support our hypothesis that human behavior in novel language tasks and environments may be better characterized by flexible composition of basic computational motifs rather than by direct specialization.},

  abstract = {An essential feature of human communication is robustness to errors: even when speakers and writers make mistakes, listeners and readers can usually determine the intended meaning. A leading hypothesis is that comprehenders achieve robust error correction by internally deploying a "noisy-channel" model of the language production process. Crucially, to best achieve error robustness, a comprehender's noisy-channel model should be finely calibrated to the environmental statistics of language production, incorporating not only prior expectations about communicative intents but also structure-sensitive likelihoods of different types of speaker error. This environmentally-calibrated noisy-channel hypothesis has been difficult to test, because the rates of most types of language production errors are hard to estimate. Here we test this hypothesis by experimentally investigating comprehenders' interpretations of subject-verb agreement errors, for which context-contingent language production error rates are feasible to estimate. In a novel free-form error correction task,  participants edited sentences with subject-verb agreement mismatches to indicate what they think was intended. Bayesian analysis of the resulting data shows that comprehenders' interpretations reflect both item-specific prior expectations and structure-sensitive error likelihoods that closely correspond to error rates in language production. These results provide quantitative evidence that humans closely track prior statistics over linguistic forms and deploy a noisy-channel model finely calibrated to statistics of the linguistic environment to achieve robust language understanding.},

We present a model that combines these two research threads, by integrating eye-movement control and sentence processing. Developing such an integrated model is extremely challenging and computationally demanding, but such an integration is an important step toward complete mathematical models of natural language comprehension in reading. We combine the SWIFT model of eye-movement control (Engbert et al., Psychological Review, 112, 2005, pp. 777-813) with key components of the Lewis and Vasishth sentence processing model (Lewis and Vasishth, Cognitive Science, 29, 2005, pp. 375-419). This integration becomes possible, for the first time, due in part to recent advances in successful parameter identification in dynamical models, which allows us to investigate profile log-likelihoods for individual model parameters. We present a fully implemented proof-of-concept model demonstrating how such an integrated model can be achieved; our approach includes Bayesian model inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling as a key computational tool. The integrated model, SEAM, can successfully reproduce eye movement patterns that arise due to similarity-based interference in reading. To our knowledge, this is the first-ever integration of a complete process model of eye-movement control with linguistic dependency completion processes in sentence comprehension. In future work, this proof of concept model will need to be evaluated using a comprehensive set of benchmark data.},

This book offers perspectives on brain dynamics that draw on the latest advances in research in the field. It includes contributions from both theoreticians and experimentalists, offering an eclectic treatment of fundamental issues.Topics addressed range from experimental and computational approaches to transient brain dynamics to the free-energy principle as a global brain theory.

This parser's approach to syntactic ambiguity points toward a tidy account both of surprisal effects and of locality effects, such as the parsing breakdowns caused by center embedding. The model provides an algorithmic-level (Marr, 1982) account of these breakdowns: The structure of the parser's memory and the nature of incremental parsing produce a smooth degradation of processing accuracy for longer center embeddings, and a steeper degradation when they are nested, in line with recall observations by Miller and Isard (1964) and speed-accuracy trade-off observations by McElree et al. (2003). Modeling results show that this effect is distinct from the effects of ambiguity and exceeds the effect of mere sentence length.},

  abstract = {Dependency parsers are among the most crucial tools in natural language processing as they have many important applications in downstream tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation and knowledge acquisition. We introduce the Yara Parser, a fast and accurate open-source dependency parser based on the arc-eager algorithm and beam search. It achieves an unlabeled accuracy of 93.32 on the standard WSJ test set which ranks it among the top dependency parsers. At its fastest, Yara can parse about 4000 sentences per second when in greedy mode (1 beam). When optimizing for accuracy (using 64 beams and Brown cluster features), Yara can parse 45 sentences per second. The parser can be trained on any syntactic dependency treebank and different options are provided in order to make it more flexible and tunable for specific tasks. It is released with the Apache version 2.0 license and can be used for both commercial and academic purposes. The parser can be found at https://github.com/yahoo/YaraParser.},

  abstract = {Develops a theory of memory retrieval and shows that it applies over a range of experimental paradigms. Access to memory traces is viewed in terms of a resonance metaphor. The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe–memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe–memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.

In this article, the model is reviewed to show how it translates behavioral data—accuracy, mean response times, and response time distributions—into components of cognitive processing. Three experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the domains of aging and neurophysiology.},

  abstract = {Linguistic typology generally divides synthetic languages into groups based on their morphological fusion. However, this measure has long been thought to be best considered a matter of degree. We present an information-theoretic measure, called informational fusion, to quantify the degree of fusion of a given set of morphological features in a surface form, which naturally provides such a graded scale. Informational fusion is able to encapsulate not only concatenative, but also nonconcatenative morphological systems (e.g. Arabic), abstracting away from any notions of morpheme segmentation. We then show, on a sample of twenty-one languages, that our measure recapitulates the usual linguistic classifications for concatenative systems, and provides new measures for nonconcatenative ones. We also evaluate the long-standing hypotheses that more frequent forms are more fusional, and that paradigm size anticorrelates with degree of fusion. We do not find evidence for the idea that languages have characteristic levels of fusion; rather, the degree of fusion varies across part-of-speech within languages.},

  abstract = {This work is a study of the French impersonal {$<$}em{$>$}on{$<$}/em{$>$} and a theory of the unique "referential deficiency" of impersonals: a range of uses that spans those covered by indefinites and definites; neutrality about content like number; systematic participation in syntactic and semantic dependencies but with unparalleled restrictions like binding of only local, number-neutral anaphora. Current understanding of the syntax and semantics of DPs and properties of French let us study this behavior in depth and extend previous findings, often in unexpected ways. The study reveals a DP with content unique in French but drawing only on options available in UG. It leads to a theory of impersonal {$<$}em{$>$}on{$<$}/em{$>$} as an indefinite DP whose content interacts with certain theories of phi-features, indefinites and definites, and anaphoric dependencies to give an explanatory account of the nature of impersonals. In turn, impersonal {$<$}em{$>$}on{$<$}/em{$>$} contributes to the theories that enter into its analysis: the relationship between syntactic underspecification and semantic neutrality, the nature of indefinites and their relationship to definites (Heim 1991, 2011; Heim 1982, Elbourne 2013), and minimal pronoun anaphora (Kratzer 2009). The study is extended to the grammaticalisation of a distinct 1PL {$<$}em{$>$}on{$<$}/em{$>$}, whose complex properties reflect the colexicalisation of impersonal {$<$}em{$>$}on{$<$}/em{$>$} and a 1PL element. We end the book on the place of impersonals in the landscape of argument coding and explore the expected parameter space through {$<$}em{$>$}on{$<$}/em{$>$}-like impersonals cross-linguistically. The work builds on the analysis of {$<$}em{$>$}on{$<$}/em{$>$} and its kin in Cinque (1988), Chierchia (1995b), Egerland (2003b), Kayne (2010), and explores them in the Principles-and-Parameters approach to syntax and the "situated descriptions" (Elbourne 2013) extension of the syntax-semantics mapping of Heim and Kratzer (1998).},

  abstract = {Summary. A general class of statistical models for a univariate response variable is presented which we call the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton–Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

Relative clauses (RCs) have long served as a key proving ground for such theories of language processing. Across three self-paced reading experiments, we test the online comprehension of Hungarian subject- and object-extracted RCs (SRCs and ORCs, respectively). We capitalize on the syntactic properties of Hungarian that allow for a variety of word orders within RCs, which helps us to delineate the processing costs associated with memory demand and violated expectations. Results showed a processing cost at the RC verb for structures that have longer verb-argument distances, despite those structures being more frequent in the corpus. These findings thus support theories that attribute processing difficulty to memory limitations, rather than theories that attribute difficulty to less expected structures.},

  abstract = {In everyday communication, speakers make errors and produce language in a noisy environment. Recent work suggests that comprehenders possess cognitive mechanisms for dealing with noise in the linguistic signal: a noisy-channel model. A key parameter of these models is the noise model: the comprehender’s implicit model of how noise affects utterances before they are perceived. Here we examine this noise model in detail, asking whether comprehension behavior reflects a noise model that is adapted to context. We asked readers to correct sentences if they noticed errors, and manipulated context by including exposure sentences containing obvious deletions (A bystander was rescued by the fireman in the nick time.), insertions, exchanges, mixed errors, or no errors. On test sentences (The bat swung the player.), participants’ corrections differed depending on the exposure condition. The results demonstrate that participants model specific types of errors and make inferences about the intentions of the speaker accordingly.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that language processing is well-adapted to noise in the input (e.g., spelling or speech errors, misreading or mishearing) and that comprehenders readily correct the input via rational inference over possible intended sentences given probable noise corruptions. In the current study, we probed the processing of noisy linguistic input, asking whether well-studied ERP components may serve as useful indices of this inferential process. In particular, we examined sentences where semantic violations could be attributed to noise—for example, in “The storyteller could turn any incident into an amusing antidote”, where the implausible word “antidote” is orthographically and phonologically close to the intended “anecdote”. We found that the processing of such sentences—where the probability that the message was corrupted by noise exceeds the probability that it was produced intentionally and perceived accurately—was associated with a reduced (less negative) N400 effect and an increased P600 effect, compared to semantic violations which are unlikely to be attributed to noise (“The storyteller could turn any incident into an amusing hearse”). Further, the magnitudes of these ERP effects were correlated with the probability that the comprehender retrieved a plausible alternative. This work thus adds to the growing body of literature that suggests that many aspects of language processing are optimized for dealing with noise in the input, and opens the door to electrophysiologic investigations of the computations that support the processing of imperfect input.},

By doing so we obtain a rich class of inference algorithms bridging the gap between variational methods and MCMC, and offering the best of both worlds: fast posterior approximation through the maximization of an explicit objective, with the option of trading off additional computation for additional accuracy. We describe the theoretical foundations that make this possible and show some promising first results.},

Although definitive answers are not yet possible, quite a bit of information relevant to the questions is now available.

We also show how linguistic properties of focus, subordination and focalization can control depth of processing, leading to underspecified representations. Modulation of degrees of specification might provide a way forward in the development of models of the processing underlying language understanding.},

Additionally, we find that the recursive syntactic composition bottleneck which represents each sentence as a single vector harms perplexity on document-level language modeling, providing evidence that a different kind of memory mechanism—one that is independent of composed syntactic representations—plays an important role in current successful models of long text.},

Functional domination is one such approach, where special emphasis is placed on finding the best possible constant upper bounding a ratio of f -divergences. Another approach used for the derivation of bounds among f -divergences relies on moment inequalities and the logarithmic-convexity property, which results in tight bounds on the relative entropy and Bhattacharyya distance in terms of χ2 divergences. A rich variety of bounds are shown to hold under boundedness assumptions on the relative information. Special attention is devoted to the total variation distance and its relation to the relative information and relative entropy, including “reverse Pinsker inequalities,” as well as on the Eγ divergence, which generalizes the total variation distance. Pinsker's inequality is extended for this type of f -divergence, a result which leads to an inequality linking the relative entropy and relative information spectrum. Integral expressions of the Rényi divergence in terms of the relative information spectrum are derived, leading to bounds on the Rényi divergence in terms of either the variational distance or relative entropy.},

  abstract = {The disambiguation of a syntactically ambiguous sentence in favor of a less preferred parse can lead to slower reading at the disambiguation point. This phenomenon, referred to as a garden-path effect, has motivated models in which readers initially maintain only a subset of the possible parses of the sentence, and subsequently require time-consuming reanalysis to reconstruct a discarded parse. A more recent proposal argues that the garden-path effect can be reduced to surprisal arising in a fully parallel parser: words consistent with the initially dispreferred but ultimately correct parse are simply less predictable than those consistent with the incorrect parse. Since predictability has pervasive effects in reading far beyond garden-path sentences, this account, which dispenses with reanalysis mechanisms, is more parsimonious. Crucially, it predicts a linear effect of surprisal: the garden-path effect is expected to be proportional to the difference in word surprisal between the ultimately correct and ultimately incorrect interpretations. To test this prediction, we used recurrent neural network language models to estimate word-by-word surprisal for three temporarily ambiguous constructions. We then estimated the slowdown attributed to each bit of surprisal from human self-paced reading times, and used that quantity to predict syntactic disambiguation difficulty. Surprisal successfully predicted the existence of garden-path effects, but drastically underpredicted their magnitude, and failed to predict their relative severity across constructions. We conclude that a full explanation of syntactic disambiguation difficulty may require recovery mechanisms beyond predictability.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that word frequency and predictability affect processing time. These effects change magnitude across tasks, but studies testing this use tasks with different response types (e.g., lexical decision, naming, and fixation time during reading; Schilling, Rayner, \& Chumbley, 1998), preventing direct comparison. Recently, Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010) overcame this problem, comparing fixation times in reading for comprehension and proofreading, showing that the frequency effect was larger in proofreading than in reading. This result could be explained by readers exhibiting substantial cognitive flexibility, and qualitatively changing how they process words in the proofreading task in a way that magnifies effects of word frequency. Alternatively, readers may not change word processing so dramatically, and instead may perform more careful identification generally, increasing the magnitude of many word processing effects (e.g., both frequency and predictability). We tested these possibilities with two experiments: subjects read for comprehension and then proofread for spelling errors (letter transpositions) that produce nonwords (e.g., trcak for track as in Kaakinen \& Hyönä) or that produce real but unintended words (e.g., trial for trail) to compare how the task changes these effects. Replicating Kaakinen and Hyönä, frequency effects increased during proofreading. However, predictability effects only increased when integration with the sentence context was necessary to detect errors (i.e., when spelling errors produced words that were inappropriate in the sentence; trial for trail). The results suggest that readers adopt sophisticated word processing strategies to accommodate task demands.},

  abstract = {The neuroscience of perception has recently been revolutionized with an integrative modeling approach in which computation, brain function, and behavior are linked across many datasets and many computational models. By revealing trends across models, this approach yields novel insights into cognitive and neural mechanisms in the target domain. We here present a systematic study taking this approach to higher-level cognition: human language processing, our species’ signature cognitive skill. We find that the most powerful “transformer” models predict nearly 100\% of explainable variance in neural responses to sentences and generalize across different datasets and imaging modalities (functional MRI and electrocorticography). Models’ neural fits (“brain score”) and fits to behavioral responses are both strongly correlated with model accuracy on the next-word prediction task (but not other language tasks). Model architecture appears to substantially contribute to neural fit. These results provide computationally explicit evidence that predictive processing fundamentally shapes the language comprehension mechanisms in the human brain.},

Following previous work in which this idea was used in spatial sampling, the method is applied to standard parameterized Bayesian optimal experimental design. Under suitable conditions, which include non-linear as well as linear regression models, it is shown in a few steps that maximizing the marginal entropy of the sample is equivalent to minimizing the pre-posterior entropy, the usual Bayesian criterion, thus avoiding the use of conditional distributions. It is shown using this marginal formulation that under normality assumptions every standard model which has a two-point prior distribution on the parameters gives an optimal design supported on a single point. Other results include a new asymptotic formula which applies as the error variance is large and bounds on support size.},

  abstract = {The influence of stimuli in psycholinguistic experiments diffuses across time because the human response to language is not instantaneous. The linear models typically used to analyze psycholinguistic data are unable to account for this phenomenon due to strong temporal independence assumptions, while existing deconvolutional methods for estimating diffuse temporal structure model time discretely and therefore cannot be directly applied to natural language stimuli where events (words) have variable duration. In light of evidence that continuous-time deconvolutional regression (CDR) can address these issues (Shain \& Schuler, 2018), this article motivates the use of CDR for many experimental settings, exposits some of its mathematical properties, and empirically evaluates the influence of various experimental confounds (noise, multicollinearity, and impulse response misspecification), hyperparameter settings, and response types (behavioral and fMRI). Results show that CDR (1) yields highly consistent estimates across a variety of hyperparameter configurations, (2) faithfully recovers the data-generating model on synthetic data, even under adverse training conditions, and (3) outperforms widely-used statistical approaches when applied to naturalistic reading and fMRI data. In addition, procedures for testing scientific hypotheses using CDR are defined and demonstrated, and empirically-motivated best-practices for CDR modeling are proposed. Results support the use of CDR for analyzing psycholinguistic time series, especially in a naturalistic experimental paradigm.},

  abstract = {Scientists often use observational time series data to study complex natural processes, from climate change to civil conflict to brain activity. But regression analyses of these data often assume simplistic dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning have yielded startling improvements to the performance of models of complex processes, from speech comprehension to nuclear physics to competitive gaming. But deep learning is generally not used for scientific analysis. Here, we bridge this gap by showing that deep learning can be used, not just to imitate, but to analyze complex processes, providing flexible function approximation while preserving interpretability. Our approach -- the continuous-time deconvolutional regressive neural network (CDRNN) -- relaxes standard simplifying assumptions (e.g., linearity, stationarity, and homoscedasticity) that are implausible for many natural systems and may critically affect the interpretation of data. We evaluate CDRNNs on incremental human language processing, a domain with complex continuous dynamics. We demonstrate dramatic improvements to predictive likelihood in behavioral and neuroimaging data, and we show that CDRNNs enable flexible discovery of novel patterns in exploratory analyses, provide robust control of possible confounds in confirmatory analyses, and open up research questions that are otherwise hard to study using observational data.},

Representational theories emphasize the demands of assembling sentence interpretations in memory; these theories predict a linear effect of predictability on processing cost. Inferential theories emphasize the demands of updating a probability distribution over possible sentence interpretations; these theories predict either a logarithmic or a superlogarithmic effect of predictability on processing cost, depending on whether they posit pressures toward a uniform distribution of information over time.

Here we revisit this question at scale: we analyze six reading datasets, estimate next-word probabilities with diverse language models, and predict reading times with advanced nonlinear regression methods.

  abstract = {In the computational and experimental psycholinguistic literature, the mechanisms behind syntactic structure building (e.g., combining words into phrases and sentences) are the subject of considerable debate.  Much experimental work has shown that surprisal is a good predictor of human behavioral and neural data. These findings have led some authors to model language comprehension in a purely probabilistic way. In this paper, we use simulation to exemplify why surprisal works so well to model human data, and to illustrate why exclusive reliance on it can be problematic for the development of a theory of language comprehension in general, and for a theory of composition in particular. Rather than arguing for the importance of structural or distributional information to the exclusion or exhaustion of the other, we argue more emphasis should be placed on how the brain leverages both types of information (viz., statistical and structured). We propose that distributional information is an important cue to the structure in the message, but is not a substitute for the structure itself - neither computationally, formally, nor conceptually. Surprisal and other distributional metrics must play a key role as theoretical objects in any explanatory mechanistic theory of language processing, but that role remains in the service of the brain’s goal of constructing structured meaning from sensory input.},

  abstract = {A longstanding open problem asks for an aperiodic monotile, also known as an "einstein": a shape that admits tilings of the plane, but never periodic tilings. We answer this problem for topological disk tiles by exhibiting a continuum of combinatorially equivalent aperiodic polygons. We first show that a representative example, the "hat" polykite, can form clusters called "metatiles", for which substitution rules can be defined. Because the metatiles admit tilings of the plane, so too does the hat. We then prove that generic members of our continuum of polygons are aperiodic, through a new kind of geometric incommensurability argument. Separately, we give a combinatorial, computer-assisted proof that the hat must form hierarchical -- and hence aperiodic -- tilings.},

  abstract = {It is well known that humans comprehend language in an incremental fashion, and that while doing so they use diverse contextual clues to make predictions about upcoming words (e.g. Tanenhaus et al., 1995). One way to model such predictions quantitatively is to use conditional probability, with P(continuation|context) denoting the fraction of the time that some continuation is expected to occur in a given context (Hale, 2001). For cognitive linguistics, such probabilities have special appeal. Generally, we seek theories that can faithfully describe the messy world of language and thought, and that are precise enough to make sharp, testable predictions; in practice we rarely achieve both goals simultaneously. Conditional probability provides a (partial) framework for representing linguistic knowledge that is subject to precise mathematics, but at the same time - unlike traditional formalisms - is amenable to incremental learning and gradient representations, and generalizes naturally to all levels of linguistic and extra-linguistic structure. Understanding the details of prediction in online language comprehension, therefore, may eventually pay considerable theoretical dividends. To this end, consider one behavioral correlate of predictability: words which are more predictable are processed faster (e.g. Ehrlich and Rayner, 1981). This effect is well known, but there is currently no agreement on why it occurs; and, since previous studies (Rayner and Well, 1996) have used exclusively factorial comparisons, we know the effect's direction but have little insight into its functional form. To address these issues, we first present a novel theory of linguistic processing time that draws inspiration from two sources: the literature on motor control, and on construction grammar (Fillmore, 1988; Kay and Fillmore, 1999). The model consists of an optimal control system (Todorov, 2004) that, rather than controlling muscles, controls the allocation of preparatory resources in the linguistic processing system. Its challenge is to manage the trade-off between conserving resources and processing quickly; for efficiency, it preferentially allocates resources to more probable continuations, which results in a speedup for predictable words. Next, following the principles of construction grammar, we constrain the model by requiring that it have no preferred scale - we assume that processing proceeds continuously and simultaneously at all levels from phoneme to clause, using similar mechanisms. This turns out to make a strong prediction: processing time for an item should be proportional to the logarithm of that item's probability-in-context. Second, we test this prediction by analyzing the relation between probability and fixation time in the Dundee eye-movement corpus (Kennedy et al., 2003), approximating probability using a computational language model. As compared to previous studies, this approach has the advantage of both improved ecological validity and vastly greater statistical power, allowing the examination of curve shape. We find that after controlling for confounds, probability does have a logarithmic effect on standard reading-time measures, and this effect is substantial and systematic over several orders of magnitude. This result invalidates a number of competing theories which predict different curve shapes, confirms the prediction of our model, and thus provides supporting evidence for constructional accounts of language processing.},

  abstract = {It is well known that real-time human language processing is highly incremental and context-driven, and that the strength of a comprehender's expectation for each word encountered is a key determinant of the difficulty of integrating that word into the preceding context. In reading, this differential difficulty is largely manifested in the amount of time taken to read each word. While numerous studies over the past thirty years have shown expectation-based effects on reading times driven by lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and other information sources, there has been little progress in establishing the quantitative relationship between expectation (or prediction) and reading times. Here, by combining a state-of-the-art computational language model, two large behavioral data-sets, and non-parametric statistical techniques, we establish for the first time the quantitative form of this relationship, finding that it is logarithmic over six orders of magnitude in estimated predictability. This result is problematic for a number of established models of eye movement control in reading, but lends partial support to an optimal perceptual discrimination account of word recognition. We also present a novel model in which language processing is highly incremental well below the level of the individual word, and show that it predicts both the shape and time-course of this effect. At a more general level, this result provides challenges for both anticipatory processing and semantic integration accounts of lexical predictability effects. And finally, this result provides evidence that comprehenders are highly sensitive to relative differences in predictability – even for differences between highly unpredictable words – and thus helps bring theoretical unity to our understanding of the role of prediction at multiple levels of linguistic structure in real-time language comprehension.},

It is shown that mean Hamming distance is a good general guide to coding efficiency, except in the case of a minimum error strategy with a deletion error channel, where coding efficiency is critically dependent on noise level. An experiment in which subjects selected codes in an artificial language suggests that the process of recall from memory is similar to the process of transmitting over a deletion error channel with a minimum error strategy. A similar interpretation can be placed on the analysis of consonant systems in English, French, German and Welsh, where the sets of consonants of a given class in a given environment are considered as codes whose alphabet is the phonological distinctive feature system of Halle (1958)},

We formulate a generative Bayesian model which seeks to explain the observed parallel data through a combination of bilingual and monolingual parameters. To this end, we adapt a formalism known as unordered tree alignment to our probabilistic setting. Using this formalism, our model loosely binds parallel trees while allowing language-specific syntactic structure. We perform inference under this model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo and dynamic programming. Applying this model to three parallel corpora (Korean-English, Urdu-English, and Chinese-English) we find substantial performance gains over the CCM model, a strong monolingual baseline. On average, across a variety of testing scenarios, our model achieves an 8.8 absolute gain in F-measure.},

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model.

Because gradients can be ill-defined and hard to estimate when the data resides on low-dimensional manifolds, we perturb the data with different levels of Gaussian noise, and jointly estimate the corresponding scores, i.e., the vector fields of gradients of the perturbed data distribution for all noise levels. For sampling, we propose an annealed Langevin dynamics where we use gradients corresponding to gradually decreasing noise levels as the sampling process gets closer to the data manifold. Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons. Our models produce samples  comparable to GANs on MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art inception score of 8.87 on CIFAR-10.

Multiplicative calculus is based on a multiplicative mechanism in the same sense that the usual calculus is based on an additive mechanism. One consequence is that, just as the usual derivative of a linear function is constant, the multiplicative derivative of an exponential function is constant (and just as the usual derivative of a constant function is 0, the multiplicative derivative of a constant function is 1). Similarly, just as two functions that have a constant difference have the same usual derivative, two functions that have a constant ratio have the same multiplicative derivative. Finally, just as many functions have infinite series representations based on the usual derivative, the same functions have infinite product representations based on the multiplicative derivative. These in turn are derived from exponential approximations to functions that are analogous to the linear approximations of the usual calculus. Multiplicative calculus is a useful supplement to the usual calculus in that it is tailored to situations involving exponential functions in the same sense that the usual calculus is tailored to situations involving linear functions.},

Two major accounts of this phenomenon make different predictions about where, in the course of incremental processing of an object relative, difficulty should first appear. An account emphasizing memory processes (Gibson, 1998; Grodner \& Gibson, 2005) predicts difficulty at the relative clause verb, while an account emphasizing experience-based expectations (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) predicts earlier difficulty, at the relative clause subject. Two eye movement experiments tested these predictions. Regressive saccades were much more likely from the subject noun phrase of an object relative than from the same noun phrase occurring within a subject relative (Experiment 1) or within a verbal complement clause (Experiment 2). This effect was further amplified when the relative pronoun that was omitted. However, reading time was also inflated on the object relative clause verb in both experiments. These results suggest that the violation of expectations and the difficulty of memory retrieval both contribute to the difficulty of object relative clauses, but that these two sources of difficulty have qualitatively distinct behavioral consequences in normal reading.},

  abstract = {A word’s predictability in context has a well-established effect on fixation durations in reading. To investigate how this effect is manifested in distributional terms, an experiment was carried out in which subjects read each of 50 target words twice, once in a high-predictability context and once in a low-predictability context. The ex-Gaussian distribution was fit to each subject’s first-fixation durations and single-fixation durations. For both measures, the μ parameter increased when a word was unpredictable, while the τ parameter was not significantly affected, indicating that a predictability manipulation shifts the distribution of fixation durations but does not affect the degree of skew. Vincentile plots showed that the mean ex-Gaussian parameters described the typical distribution shapes extremely well. These results suggest that the predictability and frequency effects are functionally distinct, since a frequency manipulation has been shown to influence both μ and τ. The results may also be seen as consistent with the finding from single-word recognition paradigms that semantic priming affects only μ.},

  abstract = {In research on the role of lexical predictability in language comprehension, predictability is generally defined as the probability that a word is provided as a sentence continuation in the cloze task (Taylor, 1953), in which subjects are asked to guess the next word of a sentence. The present experiments investigate the process by which subjects generate a cloze response, by measuring the latency to initiate a response in a version of the task in which subjects produce a spoken continuation to a visually presented sentence fragment. Higher probability responses were produced faster than lower probability responses. The latency to produce a response was also influenced by item constraint: A response at a given level of probability was issued faster when the context was more constraining, i.e., a single response was elicited with high probability. We show that these patterns are naturally produced by an activation-based race model in which potential responses independently race towards a response threshold. Implications for the interpretation of cloze probability as a measure of lexical predictability are discussed.},

  abstract = {Both everyday experience and laboratory research demonstrate that readers often fail to notice errors such as an omitted or repeated function word. This phenomenon challenges central tenets of reading and sentence processing models, according to which each word is lexically processed and incrementally integrated into a syntactic representation. One solution would propose that apparent failure to notice such errors reflects post-perceptual inference; the reader does initially perceive the error, but then unconsciously ’corrects’ the perceived string. Such a post-perceptual account predicts that when readers fail to explicitly notice an error, the error will nevertheless disrupt reading, at least fleetingly. We present a large-scale eyetracking experiment investigating whether disruption is detectable in the eye movement record when readers fail to notice an omitted or repeated two-letter function word in naturalistic sentences. Readers failed to notice both omission and repetition errors over 36\% of the time. In an analysis that included all trials, both omission and repetition resulted in pronounced eye movement disruption, compared to reading of grammatical control sentences. But in an analysis including only trials on which readers failed to notice the errors, neither type of error disrupted eye movements on any measure. Indeed, there was evidence in some measures that reading was relatively fast on the trials on which errors were missed. It does not appear that when an error is not consciously noticed, it is initially perceived, and then later corrected; rather, linguistic knowledge influences what the reader perceives.},

This article first considers the theory’s detailed predictions regarding the effects of predictability on reading time and N400 amplitude. Two rather unintuitive predictions appear to be correct based on the current evidence: There is no specific cost when an unpredictable word is encountered in a context where another word is predictable, and the function relating predictability to processing difficulty is logarithmic, not linear. Next, the article addresses the viability of the claim, also associated with Surprisal, that conditional probability is the “causal bottleneck” mediating all effects on incremental processing difficulty. This claim fares less well as conditional probability does not account for the difficulty associated with encountering a low-frequency word or the difficulty associated with garden path disambiguation. Surprisal provides a compelling account of predictability effects but does not provide a complete account of incremental processing difficulty.},

Models of parsing have explained this tendency by appealing either to a race in the construction of alternative structures or to reanalysis. However, it is also possible that readers of ambiguous sentences save time by strategically underspecifying interpretations of ambiguous attachments. In a self-paced reading study, participants viewed sentences with relative clauses that could attach to one of two sites. Type of question was also manipulated between participants in order to test whether goals can influence reading/parsing strategies. The experiment revealed an ambiguity advantage in reading times, but only when participants expected superficial comprehension questions. When participants expected queries about relative clause interpretation, disambiguating regions were inspected with more care, and the ambiguity advantage was attenuated. However, even when participants expected relative clause queries, question-answering times suggested underspecified representations of ambiguous relative clause attachments. The results support the construal and “good-enough” models of parsing.},

We measured the N400, an index of semantic access, to words of varying probability, including unpredictable words. Word predictability was measured using both cloze probabilities and a state-of-the-art machine learning language model (GPT-2). We reanalyzed five datasets (n~=~138) to demonstrate and then replicate that context-based facilitation on the N400 is graded, even among unpredictable words. Furthermore, we established that the relationship between word predictability and context-based facilitation combines linear and logarithmic functions. We argue that this composite function reveals properties of the mapping between words and semantic features and how feature- and word-related information is activated on-line.},

We find two differentiated phases during the training process: a first short phase in which the neurons learn redundant information about the target, and a second phase in which neurons start specialising and each of them learns unique information about the target. We also find that in smaller networks individual neurons learn more specific information about certain features of the input, suggesting that learning pressure can encourage disentangled representations.},

This paper proposes UL2R, a method that substantially improves existing language models and their scaling curves with a relatively tiny amount of extra compute. The key idea is to continue training a state-of-the-art large language model (e.g., PaLM) on a few more steps with UL2's mixture-of-denoiser objective. We show that, with almost negligible extra computational costs and no new sources of data, we are able to substantially improve the scaling properties of large language models on downstream metrics. In this paper, we continue training PaLM with UL2R, introducing a new set of models at 8B, 62B, and 540B scale which we call U-PaLM. Impressively, at 540B scale, we show an approximately 2x computational savings rate where U-PaLM achieves the same performance as the final PaLM 540B model at around half its computational budget (i.e., saving \$\textbackslash sim\$4.4 million TPUv4 hours). We further show that this improved scaling curve leads to 'emergent abilities' on challenging BIG-Bench tasks -- for instance, U-PaLM does much better than PaLM on some tasks or demonstrates better quality at much smaller scale (62B as opposed to 540B). Overall, we show that U-PaLM outperforms PaLM on many few-shot setups, i.e., English NLP tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning, question answering), reasoning tasks with chain-of-thought (e.g., GSM8K), multilingual tasks (MGSM, TydiQA), MMLU and challenging BIG-Bench tasks. Finally, we provide qualitative examples showing the new capabilities of U-PaLM for single and multi-span infilling.},

  abstract = {Existing pre-trained models are generally geared towards a particular class of problems. To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized \& unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 \& GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. By scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised finetuning based NLP tasks. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization. On 0-shot MMLU, UL2 20B outperforms T0 and T5 models. UL2 20B also works well with chain-of-thought prompting and reasoning, making it an appealing choice for research into reasoning at a small to medium scale of 20B parameters. Finally, we apply FLAN instruction tuning to the UL2 20B model, achieving MMLU and Big-Bench scores competitive to FLAN-PaLM 62B. We release Flax-based T5X checkpoints for the UL2 20B \& Flan-UL2 20B.},

  abstract = {Shepard has argued that a universal law should govern generalization across different domains of perception and cognition, as well as across organisms from different species or even different planets. Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. Here we recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. Our framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization. This unification allows us not only to draw deep parallels between the set-theoretic and spatial approaches, but also to significantly advance the explanatory power of set-theoretic models.},

We evaluate our method on Seneca, a low-resource endangered language spoken in North America.

These results show particular promise for languages like Seneca that are both endangered and lack extensive documentation.},

A recent attempt to create a unified cognitive model integrating these two factors relied on the parallels between the self-attention mechanism of transformer language models and cue-based retrieval theories of working memory in human sentence processing (Ryu and Lewis 2021). While Ryu and Lewis show that attention patterns in specialized attention heads of GPT-2 are consistent with similarity-based interference, a key prediction of cue-based retrieval models, their method requires identifying syntactically specialized attention heads, and makes the cognitively implausible assumption that hundreds of memory retrieval operations take place in parallel. In the present work, we develop a recurrent neural language model with a single self-attention head, which more closely parallels the memory system assumed by cognitive theories. We show that our model's single attention head captures semantic and syntactic interference effects observed in human experiments.},

Broadbent unveiled a theoretical structure that allowed collation of a substantial body of experimental literature and that was seminal in its influence on later developments. Hybrid models have been of limited current theoretical interest, probably due in part to the difficulty in testing them experimentally. As remarked earlier, the quite special case of seriality versus parallelism is difficult enough to discriminate experimentally. Among such hybrid models are those that represent processing as being serial part of the time and partially parallel within trials. There are many occasions in perceptual and memorial experiments where the information sufficient to make a correct response is embedded in only part of the total stimulus pattern presented to the subject. A finding of independence of total completion times, for instance, although perhaps more intuitively associated with parallel models, can be predicted by serial models.},

In such tasks, whether the items are processed simultaneously (in parallel) or sequentially (serially) has long been of interest to psychologists. Although certain types of parallel and serial models have been ruled out, it has proven extremely difficult to entirely separate reasonable serial and limitedcapacity parallel models on the basis of typical data. Recent advances in theory-driven methodology now permit strong tests of serial versus parallel processing in such tasks, in ways that bypass the capacity issue and that are distribution and parameter free. We employ new methodologies to assess serial versus parallel processing and find strong evidence for pure serial or pure parallel processing, with some striking apparent differences across individuals and interstimulus conditions.},

  abstract = {We show that every bounded function g: 0,1n rarr [0,1] admits an efficiently computable "simulator" function h: 0,1n rarr [0,1] such that every fixed polynomial size circuit has approximately the same correlation with g as with h. If g describes (up to scaling) a high min-entropy distribution D, then h can be used to efficiently sample a distribution D' of the same min-entropy that is indistinguishable from D by circuits of fixed polynomial size. We state and prove our result in a more abstract setting, in which we allow arbitrary finite domains instead of 0,1n, and arbitrary families of distinguishers, instead of fixed polynomial size circuits. Our result implies (a) the weak Szemeredi regularity Lemma of Frieze and Kannan (b) a constructive version of the dense model theorem of Green, Tao and Ziegler with better quantitative parameters (polynomial rather than exponential in the distinguishing probability), and (c) the Impagliazzo hardcore set Lemma. It appears to be the general result underlying the known connections between "regularity" results in graph theory, "decomposition" results in additive combinatorics, and the hardcore Lemma in complexity theory. We present two proofs of our result, one in the spirit of Nisan's proof of the hardcore Lemma via duality of linear programming, and one similar to Impagliazzo's "boosting" proof. A third proof by iterative partitioning, which gives the complexity of the sampler to be exponential in the distinguishing probability, is also implicit in the Green-Tao-Ziegler proofs of the dense model theorem.},

This monitoring process is thought to be reflected by the P600 component in the EEG. The present study further investigated this monitoring process by comparing syntactic and spelling violations in an EEG and an fMRI experiment. To assess the effect of conflict strength, misspellings were embedded in sentences that were weakly or strongly predictive of a critical word. In support of the monitoring theory, syntactic and spelling violations elicited similarly distributed P600 effects. Furthermore, the P600 effect was larger to misspellings in the strongly compared to the weakly predictive sentences. The fMRI results showed that both syntactic and spelling violations increased activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (lIFG), while only the misspellings activated additional areas. Conflict strength did not affect the hemodynamic response to spelling violations. These results extend the idea that the lIFG is involved in implementing cognitive control in the presence of representational conflicts in general to the processing of errors in language perception.},

It was introduced by Rényi as a measure of information that satisfies almost the same axioms as Kullback-Leibler divergence, and depends on a parameter that is called its order. In particular, the Rényi divergence of order 1 equals the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review and extend the most important properties of Rényi divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence, including convexity, continuity, limits of \textbackslash (\textbackslash sigma \textbackslash ) -algebras, and the relation of the special order 0 to the Gaussian dichotomy and contiguity. We also show how to generalize the Pythagorean inequality to orders different from 1, and we extend the known equivalence between channel capacity and minimax redundancy to continuous channel inputs (for all orders) and present several other minimax results.},

  abstract = {In English, Subject Relative Clauses are processed more quickly than Object Relative Clauses, but open questions remain about where in the clause slowdown occurs. The surprisal theory of incremental processing, under which processing difficulty corresponds to probabilistic expectations about upcoming material, predicts that slowdown should occur immediately on material that disambiguates the subject from object relative clause. However, evidence from eye tracking and self-paced reading studies suggests that slowdown occurs downstream of RC-disambiguating material, on the relative clause verb. These methods, however, suffer from well-known spillover effects which makes their results difficult to interpret. To address these issues, we introduce and deploy a novel variant of the Maze task for reading times (Forster, Guerrera, \&amp; Elliot, 2009), called the Interpolated Maze in two English web-based experiments. In Experiment 1, we find that the locus of reading-time differences between SRCs and ORCs falls on immediate disambiguating definite determiner. Experiment 2 provides a control, showing that ORCs are read more slowly than lexically-matching, non-anomalous material. These results provide new evidence for the locus of processing difficulty in relative clauses and support the surprisal theory of incremental processing.},

This illusion is investigated by using statements with inaccurate proper names varying in degree of overlap in attributes with target names and by registering judgment times. The results show a clear effect of semantic relatedness. Inaccuracies more often appeared to be left unnoticed in high-related statements than in low-related statements. Furthermore, the results of the corresponding judgment times indicate that judging statements with high-related inaccurate names need the same amount of time as judging statements with low-related names. However, more errors are made in this same amount of time, which indicates that high-related statements are processed less extensively. Finally, to achieve a precise judgment of high-related statements takes more time compared with low-related statements. In other words, more time is needed to unmask a high-related inaccuracy.},

Models of speech comprehension posit that when the acoustic speech signal is obscured, listeners rely more on information from other sources. However, these models take into account only word frequency information and local contexts (surrounding syllables), but not sentence-level information. To date, empirical studies investigating predictability effects in noise did not carefully control the tested speech sounds, while the literature investigating the effect of background noise on the recognition of speech sounds does not manipulate sentence predictability. Additionally, studies on the effect of background noise show conflicting results regarding which noise type affects speech comprehension most. We address this in the present experiment.{$<$}/p{$><$}/sec{$><$}sec{$><$}title{$>$}Methods{$<$}/title{$><$}p{$>$}We investigate how listeners combine information from different sources when listening to sentences embedded in background noise.

The computational estimates are particularly effective at explaining variance in the eye-tracking data without spillover. Cloze probability estimates have decent overall psychometric accuracy and are the best predictors of early fixation patterns (first fixation duration). Our results indicate that the choice of the best measurement of word predictability in context critically depends on the processing index being considered.},

  abstract = {It is well-known in statistics (e.g., Gelman \& Carlin, 2014) that treating a result as publishable just because the p-value is less than 0.05 leads to overoptimistic expectations of replicability. These effects get published, leading to an overconfident belief in replicability. We demonstrate the adverse consequences of this statistical significance filter by conducting seven direct replication attempts (268 participants in total) of a recent paper (Levy \& Keller, 2013). We show that the published claims are so noisy that even non-significant results are fully compatible with them. We also demonstrate the contrast between such small-sample studies and a larger-sample study; the latter generally yields a less noisy estimate but also a smaller effect magnitude, which looks less compelling but is more realistic. We reiterate several suggestions from the methodology literature for improving current practices.},

Unlike prior work, we train a pruning policy under an objective that measures end-to-end performance: we search for a fast and accurate policy. This poses a difficult machine learning problem, which we tackle with the lols algorithm. lols training must continually compute the effects of changing pruning decisions: we show how to make this efficient in the constituency parsing setting, via dynamic programming and change propagation algorithms. We find that optimizing end-to-end performance in this way leads to a better Pareto frontier—i.e., parsers which are more accurate for a given runtime.},

  abstract = {A single image captures the appearance and position of multiple entities in a scene as well as their complex interactions. As a consequence, natural language grounded in visual contexts tends to be diverse – with utterances differing as focus shifts to specific objects, interactions, or levels of detail. Recently, neural sequence models such as RNNs and LSTMs have been employed to produce visually-grounded language. Beam Search, the standard work-horse for decoding sequences from these models, is an approximate inference algorithm that decodes the top-B sequences in a greedy left-to-right fashion. In practice, the resulting sequences are often minor rewordings of a common utterance, failing to capture the multimodal nature of source images. To address this shortcoming, we propose Diverse Beam Search (DBS), a diversity promoting alternative to BS for approximate inference. DBS produces sequences that are significantly different from each other by incorporating diversity constraints within groups of candidate sequences during decoding; moreover, it achieves this with minimal computational or memory overhead. We demonstrate that our method improves both diversity and quality of decoded sequences over existing techniques on two visually-grounded language generation tasks – image captioning and visual question generation – particularly on complex scenes containing diverse visual content. We also show similar improvements at language-only machine translation tasks, highlighting the generality of our approach.},

Methods such as beam search and Gumbel top-k sampling can guarantee a different output for each element of the beam, but are not easy to parallelize. Alternatively, methods such as temperature sampling and its modifications (top-k sampling, nucleus sampling, typical decoding, and others), are embarrassingly parallel, but have no guarantees about duplicate samples. We present a framework for sampling according to an arithmetic code book implicitly defined by a large language model, compatible with common sampling variations, with provable beam diversity under certain conditions, as well as being embarrassingly parallel and providing unbiased and consistent expectations from the original model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on WMT machine translation, showing substantially reduced variance when estimating expected BLEU score and up to 1 point increased BLEU in oracle experiments.},

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.},

  abstract = {The experimental phenomenon known as `probability matching' is often offered as evidence in support of adaptive learning models and against the idea that people maximise their expected utility. Recent interest in dynamic-based equilibrium theories means the term re-appears in Economics. However, there seems to be conflicting views on what is actually meant by the term and about the validity of the data. The purpose of this paper is therefore threefold: First, to introduce today's readers to what is meant by probability matching, and in particular to clarify which aspects of this phenomenon challenge the utility-maximisation hypothesis. Second, to familiarise the reader with the different theoretical approaches to behaviour in such circumstances, and to focus on the differences in predictions between these theories in light of recent advances. Third, to provide a comprehensive survey of repeated, binary choice experiments.},

(1991). Broken agreement. Cognitive Psychology, 23, 45–93]), in which a verb erroneously agrees with an intervening noun. Six self-paced reading experiments examined the online mechanisms underlying the analogous attraction effects that have been shown in comprehension; namely reduced disruption for subject–verb agreement violations when these ‘attractor’ nouns intervene. One class of theories suggests that these effects are rooted in faulty representation of the number of the subject, while another class of theories suggests instead that such effects arise in the process of re-accessing subject number at the verb. Two main findings provide evidence against the first class of theories. First, attraction also occurs in relative clause configurations in which the attractor noun does not intervene between subject and verb and is not in a direct structural relationship with the subject head (e.g., ‘The drivers who the runner wave to each morning’). Second, we observe a ‘grammatical asymmetry’: attraction effects are limited to ungrammatical sentences, which would be unexpected if the representation of subject number were inherently prone to error. We argue that agreement attraction in comprehension instead reflects a cue-based retrieval mechanism that is subject to retrieval errors. The grammatical asymmetry can be accounted for under one implementation that we propose, or if the mechanism is only called upon when the predicted agreement features fail to be instantiated on the verb.},

It is hoped the reader will be ready to tackle research papers after reading the book. The first part of the text is concerned with measure-preserving transformations of probability spaces; recurrence properties, mixing properties, the Birkhoff ergodic theorem, isomorphism and spectral isomorphism, and entropy theory are discussed. Some examples are described and are studied in detail when new properties are presented. The second part of the text focuses on the ergodic theory of continuous transformations of compact metrizable spaces. The family of invariant probability measures for such a transformation is studied and related to properties of the transformation such as topological traitivity, minimality, the size of the non-wandering set, and existence of periodic points. Topological entropy is introduced and related to measure-theoretic entropy. Topological pressure and equilibrium states are discussed, and a proof is given of the variational principle that relates pressure to measure-theoretic entropies. Several examples are studied in detail. The final chapter outlines significant results and some applications of ergodic theory to other branches of mathematics.},

  abstract = {Next to propositional content, speakers distribute information in their utterances in such a way that listeners can make a distinction between new (focused) and given (non-focused) information. This is referred to as information structure. We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the role of information structure in semantic processing. Following different questions in wh-question–answer pairs (e.g. What kind of vegetable did Ming buy for cooking today?/Who bought the vegetables for cooking today?), the answer sentences (e.g., Ming bought eggplant/beef to cook today.) contained a critical word, which was either semantically appropriate (eggplant) or inappropriate (beef), and either focus or non-focus. The results showed a full N400 effect only when the critical words were in focus position. In non-focus position a strongly reduced N400 effect was observed, in line with the well-known semantic illusion effect. The results suggest that information structure facilitates semantic processing by devoting more resources to focused information.},

  abstract = {Large pretrained Transformer language models have been shown to exhibit zero-shot generalization, i.e. they can perform a wide variety of tasks that they were not explicitly trained on. However, the architectures and pretraining objectives used across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limited systematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scale evaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. In particular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causal/non-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained with two different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We train models with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, thereby increasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales. Our experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalization after purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followed by multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We therefore consider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives. We find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performant generative causal decoder models, using autoregressive language modeling as a downstream task. Furthermore, we find that pretrained causal decoder models can be efficiently adapted into non-causal decoder models, ultimately achieving competitive performance after multitask finetuning.

BLiMP consists of 67 individual datasets, each containing 1,000 minimal pairs—that is, pairs of minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability and isolate specific phenomenon in syntax, morphology, or semantics. We generate the data according to linguist-crafted grammar templates, and human aggregate agreement with the labels is 96.4\%. We evaluate n-gram, LSTM, and Transformer (GPT-2 and Transformer-XL) LMs by observing whether they assign a higher probability to the acceptable sentence in each minimal pair. We find that state-of-the-art models identify morphological contrasts related to agreement reliably, but they struggle with some subtle semantic and syntactic phenomena, such as negative polarity items and extraction islands.},

It investigates the relationship between structural and statistical language knowledge in brain dynamics, focusing on phase and amplitude modulation. Using syntactic features from constituent hierarchies and surface statistics from a transformer model as predictors of forward encoding models, we reconstructed cross-frequency neural dynamics from MEG data during audiobook listening. Our findings challenge a strict separation of linguistic structure and statistics in the brain, with both aiding neural signal reconstruction. Syntactic features had a more temporally spread impact, and both word entropy and the number of closing syntactic constituents were linked to the phase-amplitude coupling of neural dynamics, implying a role in temporal prediction and cortical oscillation alignment during speech processing. Our results indicate that structured and statistical information jointly shape neural dynamics during spoken language comprehension and suggest an integration process via a cross-frequency coupling mechanism.},

  abstract = {Comparative constructions like More people have been to Russia than I have are reported to be acceptable and meaningful by native speakers of English; yet, upon closer reflection, they are judged to be incoherent. This mismatch between initial perception and more considered judgment challenges the idea that we perceive sentences veridically, and interpret them fully; it is thus potentially revealing about the relationship between grammar and language processing. This paper presents the results of the first detailed investigation of these so-called ‘comparative illusions’. We test four hypotheses about their source: a shallow syntactic parser, some type of repair by ellipsis, an incorrectly-resolved lexical ambiguity, or a persistent event comparison interpretation. Two formal acceptability studies show that speakers are most prone to the illusion when the matrix clause supports an event comparison reading. A verbatim recall task tests and finds evidence for such construals in speakers’ recollections of the sentences. We suggest that this reflects speakers’ entertaining an interpretation that is initially consistent with the sentence, but failing to notice when this interpretation becomes unavailable at the than-clause. In particular, semantic knowledge blinds people to an illicit operator-variable configuration in the syntax. Rather than illustrating processing in the absence of grammatical analysis, comparative illusions thus underscore the importance of syntactic and semantic rules in sentence processing.},

  abstract = {Presuppositions are the parts of meanings of utterances which are backgrounded and strongly committed to by the speaker. They are carried by a diverse range of lexical items called presupposition triggers, which include determiners, particles, open class verbs, and syntactic constructions. For example, the sentence "Lee read War and Peace again" asserts that Lee read War and Peace and presupposes that she has done so previously via the trigger 'again.' Most triggers occur in contexts where their presuppositions are supported (i.e. already entailed) by a local context; however some can also occur in contexts that lack local support, in which case their presuppositions are informative. Informative use of presupposition is typically modeled via an accommodation mechanism (Lewis, 1979) that pre-updates a context prior to utterance interpretation to go along with the presuppositions of a sentence. Understanding when triggers can communicate novel information using accommodation---which I refer to as the "Novelty Problem" for presupposition triggers---is the main goal of this dissertation. The dissertation is arranged into five chapters. Chapter 1 provides a background on presupposition and accommodation, and introduces the notion of Contextual Felicity Constraints, or CFCs (Tonhauser et al., 2013). If a trigger is infelicitous in cases where its presuppositions are not entailed, it is said to be subject to a strong CFC. Chapter 2 measures the CFCs for thirteen English presupposition triggers in two online comprehension studies, making it the largest cross-trigger comparison of CFCs reported in the literature to-date. A ranking of triggers is proposed, from weak-CFC triggers to strong-CFC triggers. Chapter 3 presents a theoretical solution to the novelty problem, which views CFCs as the result of an information-structural discourse clash. The proposal, which I refer to as the Maximalty/Accommodation Clash (or MAC), treats CFCs as arising not from accommodation failure, but from downstream semantic contradictions that result from successful accommodation. Chapter 4 develops this proposal within alternative pragmatic frameworks. Finally, Chapter 5 presents two studies that test the MAC experimentally. Taken together, the results lend support for the perspective that presupposition triggers impose constraints on the context in which they are uttered and that their contextual felicity is modulated by local information structure---the two key ingredients of the MAC approach},

Deriving estimates from language models trained on monolingual and multilingual corpora, we test three predictions associated with surprisal theory: (i) whether surprisal is predictive of reading times; (ii) whether expected surprisal, i.e. contextual entropy, is predictive of reading times; (iii) and whether the linking function between surprisal and reading times is linear. We find that all three predictions are borne out crosslinguistically.

  abstract = {Regressions, or backward saccades, are common during reading, accounting for between 5\% and 20\% of all saccades. And yet, relatively little is known about what causes them. We provide an information-theoretic operationalization for two previous qualitative hypotheses about regressions, which we dub reactivation and reanalysis. We argue that these hypotheses make different predictions about the pointwise mutual information or pmi between a regression’s source and target. Intuitively, the pmi between two words measures how much more (or less) likely one word is to be present given the other. On one hand, the reactivation hypothesis predicts that regressions occur between words that are associated, implying high positive values of pmi. On the other hand, the reanalysis hypothesis predicts that regressions should occur between words that are not associated with each other, implying negative, low values of pmi. As a second theoretical contribution, we expand on previous theories by considering not only pmi but also expected values of pmi, E[pmi], where the expectation is taken over all possible realizations of the regression’s target. The rationale for this is that language processing involves making inferences under uncertainty, and readers may be uncertain about what they have read, especially if a previous word was skipped. To test both theories, we use contemporary language models to estimate pmi-based statistics over word pairs in three corpora of eye tracking data in English, as well as in six languages across three language families (Indo-European, Uralic, and Turkic). Our results are consistent across languages and models tested: Positive values of pmi and E[pmi] consistently help to predict the patterns of regressions during reading, whereas negative values of pmi and E[pmi] do not. Our information-theoretic interpretation increases the predictive scope of both theories and our studies present the first systematic crosslinguistic analysis of regressions in the literature. Our results support the reactivation hypothesis and, more broadly, they expand the number of language processing behaviors that can be linked to information-theoretic principles.},

  abstract = {We introduce Mouse Tracking for Reading (MoTR) a new incremental processing measurement tool that can be used to collect word-by-word reading times. In a MoTR trial, participants are presented with text, which is blurred, except for a small region around the tip of the mouse. Participants must move the mouse to reveal and read the text. Mouse movement is recorded, and, using a postprocessing pipeline we present, can be analyzed to produce scanpaths as well as word-by-word reading times. We validate MoTR in two suites of experiments. In the first experiment, we collect data for the English-language Provo Corpus (Luke and Christianson, 2018). We analyze scanpaths and show that participants interpolate between two types of strategies for reading during a MoTR trial – sometimes they fixate on individual words, somewhat akin to eye-tracking, while other times they produce a more constant pass over the text, slowing down in response to processing difficulties. Taking these strategies into account, we show that the word-by-word reading times produced by our data analysis pipeline correlate well with previously collected eye-tracking data for this corpus, and that these correlations are higher than those produced by SPR data, which we also collect for the corpus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is a linear relationship between by-word MoTR values and word-level surprisal values, as has been previously shown for eye-tracking data (Smith and Levy, 2013). In the second experiment, we assess whether MoTR can be used to study sentence processing phenomena in targeted psycholinguistics experiments. Using materials from Witzel et al. (2012), we show that MoTR can reveal English speakers’ preferences for low attachment during online sentence comprehension. We argue that MoTR presents a compelling tradeoff between multiple experimental considerations: It is cheap to run and can be presented in a browser enabling the collection of data over the internet. It is more naturalistic than some alternative processing measures, allowing participants to skip words and regress to previous sentence regions. Finally, it has good sensitivity, detecting signatures of psycholinguistic processing behaviors from a relatively small number of participants.},

  abstract = {Regressions, or backward saccades, are common during reading, accounting for between 5\% and 20\% of all saccades. And yet, relatively little is known about what causes them. We provide an information-theoretic operationalization for two previous qualitative hypotheses about regressions, which we dub reactivation and reanalysis. We argue that these hypotheses make different predictions about the pointwise mutual information or pmi between a regression’s source and target. Intuitively, the pmi between two words measures how much more (or less) likely one word is to be present given the other. On one hand, the reactivation hypothesis predicts that regressions occur between words that are associated, implying high positive values of pmi. On the other hand, the reanalysis hypothesis predicts that regressions should occur between words that are disassociated with each other, implying negative, low values of pmi. As a second theoretical contribution, we expand on previous theories by considering not only pmi but also expected values of pmi, E[pmi], where the expectation is taken over all possible realizations of the regression’s target. The rationale for this is that language processing involves making inferences under uncertainty, and readers may be uncertain about what they have read, especially if a previous word was skipped. To test both theories, we use contemporary language models to estimate pmi-based statistics over word pairs in three corpora of eye tracking data in English, as well as in six languages across three language families (Indo-European, Uralic, and Turkic). Our results are consistent across languages and models tested: Positive values of pmi and E[pmi] consistently help to predict the patterns of regressions during reading, whereas negative values of pmi and E[pmi] do not. Our information-theoretic interpretation increases the predictive scope of both theories and our studies present the first systematic crosslinguistic analysis of regressions in the literature. Our results support the reactivation hypothesis and, more broadly, they expand the number of language processing behaviors that can be linked to information-theoretic principles.},

The approach is model agnostic, allows one to enforce domain-specific knowledge and constraints, and enables the construction of reliable interfaces by guaranteeing the structure of the generated text.

Of particular interest were (i) whether each task was capable of revealing processing differences on these sentences and (ii) whether these effects were indicated precisely at the predicted word/region. Although there was considerable overlap in the general pattern of results from the four tasks, there were also clear differences among them in terms of the strength and timing of the observed effects. In particular, excepting sentences that tap into clause-closure commitments, both maze task versions provided robust, “localized” indications of incremental sentence processing difficulty relative to self-paced reading and eye tracking.},

  abstract = {How does language inform our downstream thinking? In particular, how do humans make meaning from language--and how can we leverage a theory of linguistic meaning to build machines that think in more human-like ways? In this paper, we propose rational meaning construction, a computational framework for language-informed thinking that combines neural language models with probabilistic models for rational inference. We frame linguistic meaning as a context-sensitive mapping from natural language into a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT)--a general-purpose symbolic substrate for generative world modeling. Our architecture integrates two computational tools that have not previously come together: we model thinking with probabilistic programs, an expressive representation for commonsense reasoning; and we model meaning construction with large language models (LLMs), which support broad-coverage translation from natural language utterances to code expressions in a probabilistic programming language. We illustrate our framework through examples covering four core domains from cognitive science: probabilistic reasoning, logical and relational reasoning, visual and physical reasoning, and social reasoning. In each, we show that LLMs can generate context-sensitive translations that capture pragmatically-appropriate linguistic meanings, while Bayesian inference with the generated programs supports coherent and robust commonsense reasoning. We extend our framework to integrate cognitively-motivated symbolic modules (physics simulators, graphics engines, and planning algorithms) to provide a unified commonsense thinking interface from language. Finally, we explore how language can drive the construction of world models themselves. We hope this work will provide a roadmap towards cognitive models and AI systems that synthesize the insights of both modern and classical computational perspectives.},

  abstract = {This article discusses a general framework for smoothing parameter estimation for models with regular likelihoods constructed in terms of unknown smooth functions of covariates. Gaussian random effects and parametric terms may also be present. By construction the method is numerically stable and convergent, and enables smoothing parameter uncertainty to be quantified. The latter enables us to fix a well known problem with AIC for such models, thereby improving the range of model selection tools available. The smooth functions are represented by reduced rank spline like smoothers, with associated quadratic penalties measuring function smoothness. Model estimation is by penalized likelihood maximization, where the smoothing parameters controlling the extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. The methods cover, for example, generalized additive models for nonexponential family responses (e.g., beta, ordered categorical, scaled t distribution, negative binomial and Tweedie distributions), generalized additive models for location scale and shape (e.g., two stage zero inflation models, and Gaussian location-scale models), Cox proportional hazards models and multivariate additive models. The framework reduces the implementation of new model classes to the coding of some standard derivatives of the log-likelihood. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Constructing minimum ultrametric trees from distance matrices is an important problem in computational biology. In this paper, we examine its computational complexity and approximability. When the distances satisfy the triangle inequality, we show that the minimum ultrametric tree problem can be approximated in polynomial time with error ratio 1.5(1 + ⌈log n⌉), where n is the number of species. We also develop an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm for constructing the minimum ultrametric tree for both metric and non-metric inputs. The experimental results show that it can find an optimal solution for 25 species within reasonable time, while, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of algorithms solving the problem even for 12 species.},

Given a probabilistic program, we are interested in the task of posterior inference: estimating a latent variable given a set of observed variables. Existing techniques for inference in probabilistic programs often require choosing many hyper-parameters, are computationally expensive, and/or only work for restricted classes of programs. Here we formulate inference as masked language modeling: given a program, we generate a supervised dataset of variables and assignments, and randomly mask a subset of the assignments. We then train a neural network to unmask the random values, defining an approximate posterior distribution. By optimizing a single neural network across a range of programs we amortize the cost of training, yielding a ``foundation'' posterior able to do zero-shot inference for new programs. The foundation posterior can also be fine-tuned for a particular program and dataset by optimizing a variational inference objective. We show the efficacy of the approach, zero-shot and fine-tuned, on a benchmark of STAN programs.},

A frequently studied case involves illusory licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs) like ever and any, which must appear in the scope (i.e., c-command domain) of a negative element. Speakers often show intrusive licensing effects in sentences where an NPI is preceded but not c-commanded by a negative element, as in ∗The restaurants that no newspapers have recommended in their reviews have ever gone out of business. Existing accounts of intrusive licensing have focused on the role of general memory retrieval processes. In contrast, we propose that intrusive licensing of NPIs reflects semantic/pragmatic processes that are more specific to NPI licensing. As a test of this claim, we present results from an ERP study that presents a structurally matched comparison of intrusive licensing in two types of linguistic dependencies, namely NPI licensing and the binding of reflexive anaphors like himself, and herself. In the absence of a potential licensor, both NPIs and reflexives elicit a P600 response, but whereas there is an immediate ERP analog of the intrusion effect for NPI licensing, no such effect is found for reflexive binding. This suggests that the NPI intrusion effect does not reflect general-purpose retrieval mechanisms.},

Here, we extend the investigation by examining eyetracking corpora of seven languages: Danish, Dutch, English, German, Japanese, Mandarin, and Russian. We find evidence for superlinearity in some languages, but the results are highly sensitive to which language model is used to estimate surprisal.},

  abstract = {Sampling is a promising bottom-up method for exposing what generative models have learned about language, but it remains unclear how to generate representative samples from popular masked language models (MLMs) like BERT. The MLM objective yields a dependency network with no guarantee of consistent conditional distributions, posing a problem for naive approaches. Drawing from theories of iterated learning in cognitive science, we explore the use of serial reproduction chains to sample from BERT's priors. In particular, we observe that a unique and consistent estimator of the ground-truth joint distribution is given by a Generative Stochastic Network (GSN) sampler, which randomly selects which token to mask and reconstruct on each step. We show that the lexical and syntactic statistics of sentences from GSN chains closely match the ground-truth corpus distribution and perform better than other methods in a large corpus of naturalness judgments. Our findings establish a firmer theoretical foundation for bottom-up probing and highlight richer deviations from human priors.},

  abstract = {In variational inference (VI), coordinate-ascent and gradient-based approaches are two major types of algorithms for approximating difficult-to-compute probability densities. In real-world implementations of complex models, Monte Carlo methods are widely used to estimate expectations in coordinate-ascent approaches and gradients in derivative-driven ones. We discuss a Monte Carlo co-ordinate ascent VI (MC-CAVI) algorithm that makes use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in the calculation of expectations required within co-ordinate ascent VI (CAVI). We show that, under regularity conditions, an MC-CAVI recursion will get arbitrarily close to a maximiser of the evidence lower bound with any given high probability. In numerical examples, the performance of MC-CAVI algorithm is compared with that of MCMC and—as a representative of derivative-based VI methods—of Black Box VI (BBVI). We discuss and demonstrate MC-CAVI’s suitability for models with hard constraints in simulated and real examples. We compare MC-CAVI’s performance with that of MCMC in an important complex model used in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data analysis—BBVI is nearly impossible to be employed in this setting due to the hard constraints involved in the model.},

We investigate whether these components—the composition function and the self-attention mechanism—can both induce human-like syntactic generalization. Specifically, we train language models (LMs) with and without these two components with the model sizes carefully controlled, and evaluate their syntactic generalization performance against six test circuits on the SyntaxGym benchmark. The results demonstrated that the composition function and the self-attention mechanism both play an important role to make LMs more human-like, and closer inspection of linguistic phenomenon implied that the composition function allowed syntactic features, but not semantic features, to percolate into subtree representations.},

Unlike direct models which can suffer from explaining-away effects during training, noisy channel models must produce outputs that explain their inputs, and their component models can be trained with not only paired training samples but also unpaired samples from the marginal output distribution. Using a latent variable to control how much of the conditioning sequence the channel model needs to read in order to generate a subsequent symbol, we obtain a tractable and effective beam search decoder. Experimental results on abstractive sentence summarisation, morphological inflection, and machine translation show that noisy channel models outperform direct models, and that they significantly benefit from increased amounts of unpaired output data that direct models cannot easily use.},

In particular, perceptual salience (e.g., visual salience of objects in the world, acoustic prominence of linguistic sounds) and semantic-pragmatic salience (e.g., prominence of recently mentioned or topical referents) have been shown to influence language comprehension and production. A different line of research has sought to account for behavioral correlates of cognitive load during comprehension as well as for certain patterns in language usage using information-theoretic notions, such as {$<$}italic{$>$}surprisal{$<$}/italic{$>$}. Surprisal and salience both affect language processing at different levels, but the relationship between the two has not been adequately elucidated, and the question of whether salience can be reduced to surprisal / predictability is still open. Our review identifies two main challenges in addressing this question: terminological inconsistency and lack of integration between high and low levels of representations in salience-based accounts and surprisal-based accounts. We capitalize upon work in visual cognition in order to orient ourselves in surveying the different facets of the notion of salience in linguistics and their relation with models of surprisal. We find that work on salience highlights aspects of linguistic communication that models of surprisal tend to overlook, namely the role of attention and relevance to current goals, and we argue that the Predictive Coding framework provides a unified view which can account for the role played by attention and predictability at different levels of processing and which can clarify the interplay between low and high levels of processes and between predictability-driven expectation and attention-driven focus.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

It is an attempt to open-source a 100B-scale model at least as good as GPT-3 and unveil how models of such a scale can be successfully pre-trained. Over the course of this effort, we face numerous unexpected technical and engineering challenges, particularly on loss spikes and disconvergence. In this paper, we introduce the training process of GLM-130B including its design choices, training strategies for both efficiency and stability, and engineering efforts. The resultant GLM-130B model offers significant outperformance over GPT-3 175B on a wide range of popular English benchmarks while the performance advantage is not observed in OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B. It also consistently and significantly outperforms ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B -- the largest Chinese language model -- across related benchmarks. Finally, we leverage a unique scaling property of GLM-130B to reach INT4 quantization, without quantization aware training and with almost no performance loss, making it the first among 100B-scale models. More importantly, the property allows its effective inference on 4\$\textbackslash times\$RTX 3090 (24G) or 8\$\textbackslash times\$RTX 2080 Ti (11G) GPUs, the most ever affordable GPUs required for using 100B-scale models.

Studies have shown that optional reduction in language is sensitive to contextual predictability, such that more predictable a linguistic unit is, the more likely it is to get reduced. Yet it is unclear whether these cases of speaker choice are driven by audience design versus toward facilitating production. Here we argue that for a different optionality phenomenon, namely classifier choice in Mandarin Chinese, Uniform Information Density and at least one plausible variant of availability-based production make opposite predictions regarding the relationship between the predictability of the upcoming material and speaker choices. In a corpus analysis of Mandarin Chinese, we show that the distribution of speaker choices supports the availability-based production account and not the Uniform Information Density.},

We present a framework to allow specification of combinatorial constraints for sentence generation. We propose TSMC, an efficient method to generate high likelihood sentences with respect to a pre-trained language model while satisfying the constraints. Our approach is highly flexible, requires no task-specific train- ing, and leverages efficient constraint satisfaction solving techniques. To better handle the combinatorial constraints, a tree search algorithm is embedded into the proposal process of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to explore candidates that satisfy more constraints. Compared to existing MCMC approaches, our sampling approach has a better mixing performance. Experiments show that TSMC achieves consistent and significant improvement on multiple language generation tasks.},

Four decades of research have failed to resolve the source of this entrenched semantic illusion. Here we adopt the noisy-channel framework for language comprehension to provide a potential explanation. We hypothesize that depth-charge sentences result from inferences whereby comprehenders derive the interpretation by weighing the plausibility of possible readings of the depth-charge sentences against the likelihood of plausible sentences being produced with errors. In four experiments, we find that (1) the more plausible the intended meaning of the depth-charge sentence is, the more likely the sentence is to be misinterpreted; and (2) the higher the likelihood of our hypothesized noise operations, the more likely depth-charge sentences are to be misinterpreted. These results suggest that misinterpretation is affected by both world knowledge and the distance between the depth-charge sentence and a plausible alternative, which is consistent with the noisy-channel framework.},

  abstract = {The comparative illusion sentence, "More students have been to Russia than I have", is acceptable on first reading, but upon closer examination, its meaning becomes hard to discern. Previous research has identified several factors that affect the illusion degree -- the repeatability of the action ("go to Russia" vs. "escape from Russia"), the than-clause subject form (pronoun "I" vs. noun phrase "the teacher"), and the subject number (singular vs. plural) (O’Connor, 2015; Wellwood et al. 2018), but there has not been a thorough explanation of how the illusion arises. We propose a noisy-channel explanation (Gibson et al. 2013; Levy, 2008) and argue that readers could arrive at any of three possible interpretations (event comparison, event negation, individual comparison) depending on (1) the structural distance between the perceived anomalous sentence and the alternative which carries the interpretation and (2) the plausibility of the associated interpretation. Through a series of experiments, we show that, given equal plausibility of the possible interpretations, participants are more likely to choose the interpretation associated with the structure that necessitates the fewest and more probable edits. This study provides another linguistic phenomenon supporting the rational aspect of human language processing.},

  abstract = {Language models (LMs) have been argued to overlap substantially with human beings in grammaticality judgment tasks. But when humans systematically make errors in language processing, should we expect LMs to behave like cognitive models of language and mimic human behavior? We answer this question by investigating LMs' more subtle judgments associated with “language illusions” – sentences that are vague in meaning, implausible, or ungrammatical but receive unexpectedly high acceptability judgments by humans. We looked at three illusions: the comparative illusion (e.g. “More people have been to Russia than I have”), the depth-charge illusion (e.g. “No head injury is too trivial to be ignored”), and the negative polarity item (NPI) illusion (e.g. “The hunter who no villager believed to be trustworthy will ever shoot a bear”). We found that probabilities represented by LMs were more likely to align with human judgments of being “tricked” by the NPI illusion which examines a structural dependency, compared to the comparative and the depth-charge illusions which require sophisticated semantic understanding. No single LM or metric yielded results that are entirely consistent with human behavior. Ultimately, we show that LMs are limited both in their construal as cognitive models of human language processing and in their capacity to recognize nuanced but critical information in complicated language materials.},

  abstract = {During language comprehension, people sometimes accept sentences that are ungrammatical or semantically implausible and the cognitive mechanism underlying this language illusion is understudied. In this paper, we study the “comparative illusion” (CI) phenomenon where people believe the sentence "More people have been to Russia than I have" to be acceptable while in fact it is semantically ill-formed. We provide a potential explanation for the reasons behind the language illusion from the noisy-channel framework. We hypothesize that comprehenders make rational inference over the perceived sentence by entertaining alternative plausible interpretations and weighing the likelihood of the plausible interpretation being produced with errors. In four experiments, we identified the construction that elicited the most salient illusion effect, established the range of the plausible interpretations, and found that the probability for comprehenders to assign a certain plausible interpretation to the CI sentence is proportional to how likely they think that that interpretation is encapsulated into the CI sentence during speech production. This finding is consistent with the noisy-channel predictions and provides another example supporting the rational behavior underlying language comprehension.},

In this work, we leverage the rich toolkit of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for these probabilistic inference problems. In particular, we use learned twist functions to estimate the expected future value of the potential at each timestep, which enables us to focus inference-time computation on promising partial sequences. We propose a novel contrastive method for learning the twist functions, and establish connections with the rich literature of soft reinforcement learning. As a complementary application of our twisted SMC framework, we present methods for evaluating the accuracy of language model inference techniques using novel bidirectional SMC bounds on the log partition function. These bounds can be used to estimate the KL divergence between the inference and target distributions in both directions. We apply our inference evaluation techniques to show that twisted SMC is effective for sampling undesirable outputs from a pretrained model (a useful component of harmlessness training and automated red-teaming), generating reviews with varied sentiment, and performing infilling tasks.},

We propose that good tokenizers lead to efficient channel usage, where the channel is the means by which some input is conveyed to the model and efficiency can be quantified in information-theoretic terms as the ratio of the Shannon entropy to the maximum entropy of the subword distribution.Nevertheless, an optimal encoding according to Shannon entropy assigns extremely long codes to low-frequency subwords and very short codes to high-frequency subwords.Defining efficiency in terms of Rényi entropy, on the other hand, penalizes distributions with either very high or very low-frequency subwords.We posit that (1) extremely high-frequency subwords are problematic because their meaning is not distinct and (2) that low-frequency subwords may not appear frequently enough for their meaning to be learned properly; encodings that induce unigram distributions with either can harm model performance.In machine translation, we find that across multiple tokenizers, the Rényi entropy has a very strong correlation with BLEU: 0.82 in comparison to just -0.30 for compressed length.},
